0,35660797,"PD-1 Blockade in Mismatch Repair-Deficient, Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer - PubMed","Abstract
        
      



          Background:
        
      
      Neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiation followed by surgical resection of the rectum is a standard treatment for locally advanced rectal cancer. A subset of rectal cancer is caused by a deficiency in mismatch repair. Because mismatch repair-deficient colorectal cancer is responsive to programmed death 1 (PD-1) blockade in the context of metastatic disease, it was hypothesized that checkpoint blockade could be effective in patients with mismatch repair-deficient, locally advanced rectal cancer.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We initiated a prospective phase 2 study in which single-agent dostarlimab, an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, was administered every 3 weeks for 6 months in patients with mismatch repair-deficient stage II or III rectal adenocarcinoma. This treatment was to be followed by standard chemoradiotherapy and surgery. Patients who had a clinical complete response after completion of dostarlimab therapy would proceed without chemoradiotherapy and surgery. The primary end points are sustained clinical complete response 12 months after completion of dostarlimab therapy or pathological complete response after completion of dostarlimab therapy with or without chemoradiotherapy and overall response to neoadjuvant dostarlimab therapy with or without chemoradiotherapy.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 12 patients have completed treatment with dostarlimab and have undergone at least 6 months of follow-up. All 12 patients (100%; 95% confidence interval, 74 to 100) had a clinical complete response, with no evidence of tumor on magnetic resonance imaging, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron-emission tomography, endoscopic evaluation, digital rectal examination, or biopsy. At the time of this report, no patients had received chemoradiotherapy or undergone surgery, and no cases of progression or recurrence had been reported during follow-up (range, 6 to 25 months). No adverse events of grade 3 or higher have been reported.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Mismatch repair-deficient, locally advanced rectal cancer was highly sensitive to single-agent PD-1 blockade. Longer follow-up is needed to assess the duration of response. (Funded by the Simon and Eve Colin Foundation and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04165772.).",{},{},{}
1,35658024,Tirzepatide Once Weekly for the Treatment of Obesity - PubMed,"Abstract
        
      



          Background:
        
      
      Obesity is a chronic disease that results in substantial global morbidity and mortality. The efficacy and safety of tirzepatide, a novel glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, in people with obesity are not known.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this phase 3 double-blind, randomized, controlled trial, we assigned 2539 adults with a body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) of 30 or more, or 27 or more and at least one weight-related complication, excluding diabetes, in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive once-weekly, subcutaneous tirzepatide (5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg) or placebo for 72 weeks, including a 20-week dose-escalation period. Coprimary end points were the percentage change in weight from baseline and a weight reduction of 5% or more. The treatment-regimen estimand assessed effects regardless of treatment discontinuation in the intention-to-treat population.
    


          Results:
        
      
      At baseline, the mean body weight was 104.8 kg, the mean BMI was 38.0, and 94.5% of participants had a BMI of 30 or higher. The mean percentage change in weight at week 72 was -15.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], -15.9 to -14.2) with 5-mg weekly doses of tirzepatide, -19.5% (95% CI, -20.4 to -18.5) with 10-mg doses, and -20.9% (95% CI, -21.8 to -19.9) with 15-mg doses and -3.1% (95% CI, -4.3 to -1.9) with placebo (P<0.001 for all comparisons with placebo). The percentage of participants who had weight reduction of 5% or more was 85% (95% CI, 82 to 89), 89% (95% CI, 86 to 92), and 91% (95% CI, 88 to 94) with 5 mg, 10 mg, and 15 mg of tirzepatide, respectively, and 35% (95% CI, 30 to 39) with placebo; 50% (95% CI, 46 to 54) and 57% (95% CI, 53 to 61) of participants in the 10-mg and 15-mg groups had a reduction in body weight of 20% or more, as compared with 3% (95% CI, 1 to 5) in the placebo group (P<0.001 for all comparisons with placebo). Improvements in all prespecified cardiometabolic measures were observed with tirzepatide. The most common adverse events with tirzepatide were gastrointestinal, and most were mild to moderate in severity, occurring primarily during dose escalation. Adverse events caused treatment discontinuation in 4.3%, 7.1%, 6.2%, and 2.6% of participants receiving 5-mg, 10-mg, and 15-mg tirzepatide doses and placebo, respectively.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In this 72-week trial in participants with obesity, 5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg of tirzepatide once weekly provided substantial and sustained reductions in body weight. (Supported by Eli Lilly; SURMOUNT-1 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04184622.).",{},{},{}
2,35665782,Trastuzumab Deruxtecan in Previously Treated HER2-Low Advanced Breast Cancer - PubMed,"Abstract
        
      



          Background:
        
      
      Among breast cancers without human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) amplification, overexpression, or both, a large proportion express low levels of HER2 that may be targetable. Currently available HER2-directed therapies have been ineffective in patients with these ""HER2-low"" cancers.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We conducted a phase 3 trial involving patients with HER2-low metastatic breast cancer who had received one or two previous lines of chemotherapy. (Low expression of HER2 was defined as a score of 1+ on immunohistochemical [IHC] analysis or as an IHC score of 2+ and negative results on in situ hybridization.) Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive trastuzumab deruxtecan or the physician's choice of chemotherapy. The primary end point was progression-free survival in the hormone receptor-positive cohort. The key secondary end points were progression-free survival among all patients and overall survival in the hormone receptor-positive cohort and among all patients.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of 557 patients who underwent randomization, 494 (88.7%) had hormone receptor-positive disease and 63 (11.3%) had hormone receptor-negative disease. In the hormone receptor-positive cohort, the median progression-free survival was 10.1 months in the trastuzumab deruxtecan group and 5.4 months in the physician's choice group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.51; P<0.001), and overall survival was 23.9 months and 17.5 months, respectively (hazard ratio for death, 0.64; P = 0.003). Among all patients, the median progression-free survival was 9.9 months in the trastuzumab deruxtecan group and 5.1 months in the physician's choice group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.50; P<0.001), and overall survival was 23.4 months and 16.8 months, respectively (hazard ratio for death, 0.64; P = 0.001). Adverse events of grade 3 or higher occurred in 52.6% of the patients who received trastuzumab deruxtecan and 67.4% of those who received the physician's choice of chemotherapy. Adjudicated, drug-related interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis occurred in 12.1% of the patients who received trastuzumab deruxtecan; 0.8% had grade 5 events.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In this trial involving patients with HER2-low metastatic breast cancer, trastuzumab deruxtecan resulted in significantly longer progression-free and overall survival than the physician's choice of chemotherapy.

3,35668298,Histone editing elucidates the functional roles of H3K27 methylation and acetylation in mammals - PubMed,"Abstract
        
      


      
      Posttranslational modifications of histones (PTMs) are associated with specific chromatin and gene expression states1,2. Although studies in Drosophila melanogaster have revealed phenotypic associations between chromatin-modifying enzymes and their histone substrates, comparable studies in mammalian models do not exist3-5. Here, we use CRISPR base editing in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) to address the regulatory role of lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27), a substrate for Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2)-mediated methylation and CBP/EP300-mediated acetylation6,7. By generating pan-H3K27R (pK27R) mutant mESCs, where all 28 alleles of H3.1, H3.2 and H3.3 have been mutated, we demonstrate similarity in transcription patterns of genes and differentiation to PRC2-null mutants. Moreover, H3K27 acetylation is not essential for gene derepression linked to loss of H3K27 methylation, or de novo activation of genes during cell-fate transition to epiblast-like cells (EpiLCs). In conclusion, our results show that H3K27 is an essential substrate for PRC2 in mESCs, whereas other PTMs in addition to H3K27 acetylation are likely involved in mediating CBP/EP300 function. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of large-scale multicopy gene editing to interrogate histone PTM function in mammalian cells.",{},{},{}
4,35649412,Glioma progression is shaped by genetic evolution and microenvironment interactions - PubMed,"Abstract
        
      


      
      The factors driving therapy resistance in diffuse glioma remain poorly understood. To identify treatment-associated cellular and genetic changes, we analyzed RNA and/or DNA sequencing data from the temporally separated tumor pairs of 304 adult patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-wild-type and IDH-mutant glioma. Tumors recurred in distinct manners that were dependent on IDH mutation status and attributable to changes in histological feature composition, somatic alterations, and microenvironment interactions. Hypermutation and acquired CDKN2A deletions were associated with an increase in proliferating neoplastic cells at recurrence in both glioma subtypes, reflecting active tumor growth. IDH-wild-type tumors were more invasive at recurrence, and their neoplastic cells exhibited increased expression of neuronal signaling programs that reflected a possible role for neuronal interactions in promoting glioma progression. Mesenchymal transition was associated with the presence of a myeloid cell state defined by specific ligand-receptor interactions with neoplastic cells. Collectively, these recurrence-associated phenotypes represent potential targets to alter disease progression.

5,35672419,Dietary restriction and the transcription factor clock delay eye aging to extend lifespan in Drosophila Melanogaster - PubMed,"Abstract
        
      


      
      Many vital processes in the eye are under circadian regulation, and circadian dysfunction has emerged as a potential driver of eye aging. Dietary restriction is one of the most robust lifespan-extending therapies and amplifies circadian rhythms with age. Herein, we demonstrate that dietary restriction extends lifespan in Drosophila melanogaster by promoting circadian homeostatic processes that protect the visual system from age- and light-associated damage. Altering the positive limb core molecular clock transcription factor, CLOCK, or CLOCK-output genes, accelerates visual senescence, induces a systemic immune response, and shortens lifespan. Flies subjected to dietary restriction are protected from the lifespan-shortening effects of photoreceptor activation. Inversely, photoreceptor inactivation, achieved via mutating rhodopsin or housing flies in constant darkness, primarily extends the lifespan of flies reared on a high-nutrient diet. Our findings establish the eye as a diet-sensitive modulator of lifespan and indicates that vision is an antagonistically pleiotropic process that contributes to organismal aging.",{},{},{}
6,35662413,An inter-organ neural circuit for appetite suppression - PubMed,"Abstract
        
      


      
      Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a signal peptide released from enteroendocrine cells of the lower intestine. GLP-1 exerts anorectic and antimotility actions that protect the body against nutrient malabsorption. However, little is known about how intestinal GLP-1 affects distant organs despite rapid enzymatic inactivation. We show that intestinal GLP-1 inhibits gastric emptying and eating via intestinofugal neurons, a subclass of myenteric neurons that project to abdominal sympathetic ganglia. Remarkably, cell-specific ablation of intestinofugal neurons eliminated intestinal GLP-1 effects, and their chemical activation functioned as a GLP-1 mimetic. GLP-1 sensing by intestinofugal neurons then engaged a sympatho-gastro-spinal-reticular-hypothalamic pathway that links abnormal stomach distension to craniofacial programs for food rejection. Within this pathway, cell-specific activation of discrete neuronal populations caused systemic GLP-1-like effects. These molecularly identified, delimited enteric circuits may be targeted to ameliorate the abdominal bloating and loss of appetite typical of gastric motility disorders.

7,35668317,"Does Ocrelizumab Limit Multiple Sclerosis Progression? Current Evidence from Clinical, MRI, and Fluid Biomarkers - PubMed","Abstract
        
      


      
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory, demyelinating, and neurodegenerative disease affecting the central nervous system, often characterized by the accumulation of irreversible clinical disability over time. In recent years, there has been a dramatic evolution in several key concepts of MS treatment. The demonstration of the effects of ocrelizumab, a selective monoclonal antibody against CD20+ B cells, has significantly modified our knowledge of the immune-pathophysiology of MS and has provided a new therapeutic target for relapsing and progressive MS patients. Emerging findings suggest that, besides its strong anti-inflammatory activity, ocrelizumab may limit disability progression and may exert beneficial effects on cognitive function, fatigue, and quality of life of MS patients. The significant reductions of the rate of global and regional brain atrophy and of serum neurofilament light chain levels, which were found to be partially independent of overt inflammatory activity, suggest that this treatment may also limit neuro-axonal damage. By discussing the most recent evidence regarding the effects of ocrelizumab on clinical measures as well as on magnetic resonance imaging and fluid biomarkers, this review summarizes current knowledge on the possible mechanisms underlying the effects of ocrelizumab in limiting MS progression and neurodegeneration.

8,35649707,Short-term effectiveness of high-load compared with low-load strengthening exercise on self-reported function in patients with hypermobile shoulders: a randomised controlled trial - PubMed,"Abstract
        
      



          Objectives:
        
      
      To investigate the short-term effectiveness of high-load versus low-load strengthening exercise on self-reported function in patients with hypermobility spectrum disorder (HSD) and shoulder symptoms.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A superiority, parallel-group, randomised trial (balanced block randomisation, electronic concealment) including adult patients (n=100) from primary care with HSD and shoulder pain and/or shoulder instability ≥3 months. Patients received 16 weeks of shoulder exercises (three sessions/week): HEAVY (n=50, full-range, high-load, supervised twice/week) or LIGHT (n=50, neutral/mid-range, low-load, supervised three times). The primary outcome was the 16-week between-group difference in self-reported function measured with the Western Ontario Shoulder Instability Index (WOSI, scale 0-2100, 0=best, minimal important difference 252 points). Secondary outcomes were self-reported measures including quality of life and clinical tests including shoulder muscle strength and range of motion. An intention-to-treat analysis with multiple imputation was conducted by a blinded biostatistician using linear regression.
    


          Results:
        
      
      93 of 100 patients (93%) completed the 16-week evaluation. The mean WOSI score between-group difference significantly favoured HEAVY (-174.5 points, 95% CI -341.4 to -7.7, adjusted for age, sex, baseline score, clustering around clinic). The secondary outcomes were inconclusive, but patients in HEAVY were less likely to have a positive shoulder rotation test >180°, and more likely to rate an important improvement in physical symptoms. There were no serious adverse events, but HEAVY was associated with more transient muscle soreness (56% vs 37%) and headaches (40% vs 20%).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      High-load shoulder strengthening exercise was statistically superior to low-load strengthening exercise for self-reported function at 16 weeks and may be used in primary care to treat patients with HSD and shoulder pain and/or instability to improve shoulder function in the short term. Further studies are needed to confirm the clinical relevance, and patients should be supported to manage associated minor adverse events.

9,35654037,Neuronal NLRP3 is a parkin substrate that drives neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease - PubMed,"Abstract
        
      


      
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is mediated, in part, by intraneuronal accumulation of α-synuclein aggregates andsubsequent death of dopamine (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). Microglial hyperactivation of the NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome has been well-documented in various neurodegenerative diseases, including PD. We show here that loss of parkin activity in mouse and human DA neurons results in spontaneous neuronal NLRP3 inflammasome assembly, leading to DA neuron death. Parkin normally inhibits inflammasome priming by ubiquitinating and targeting NLRP3 for proteasomal degradation. Loss of parkin activity also contributes to the assembly of an active NLRP3 inflammasome complex via mitochondrial-derived reactive oxygen species (mitoROS) generation through the accumulation of another parkin ubiquitination substrate, ZNF746/PARIS. Inhibition of neuronal NLRP3 inflammasome assembly prevents degeneration of DA neurons in familial and sporadic PD models. Strategies aimed at limiting neuronal NLRP3 inflammasome activation hold promise as a disease-modifying therapy for PD.

      The advent of COVID-19 and the persistent threat of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria, influenza and HIV/AIDS remind us of the marked impact that infections continue to have on public health. Some of the most effective protective measures are vaccines but these have been difficult to develop for some of these infectious diseases even after decades of research. The development of drugs and immunotherapies acting directly against the pathogen can be equally challenging, and such pathogen-directed therapeutics have the potential disadvantage of selecting for resistance. An alternative approach is provided by host-directed therapies, which interfere with host cellular processes required for pathogen survival or replication, or target the host immune response to infection (immunotherapies) to either augment immunity or ameliorate immunopathology. Here, we provide a historical perspective of host-directed immunotherapeutic interventions for viral and bacterial infections and then focus on SARS-CoV-2 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, two major human pathogens of the current era, to indicate the key lessons learned and discuss candidate immunotherapeutic approaches, with a focus on drugs currently in clinical trials.",{'Review': True},{},{}

      In patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, the effect of adding autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) to triplet therapy (lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone [RVD]), followed by lenalidomide maintenance therapy until disease progression, is unknown.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this phase 3 trial, adults (18 to 65 years of age) with symptomatic myeloma received one cycle of RVD. We randomly assigned these patients, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive two additional RVD cycles plus stem-cell mobilization, followed by either five additional RVD cycles (the RVD-alone group) or high-dose melphalan plus ASCT followed by two additional RVD cycles (the transplantation group). Both groups received lenalidomide until disease progression, unacceptable side effects, or both. The primary end point was progression-free survival.

      Epicondylitis is common in young patients and athletes. It is usually addressed with uneffective or very aggressive treatments. Due to the recurrence of the condition and the disability it causes its management is very demanding.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Five patients ages 30-45 years with diagnosis of epicondylitis were treated and followed-up.

      Hijacking the cellular protein degradation system offers unique opportunities for drug discovery, as exemplified by proteolysis-targeting chimeras. Despite their great promise for medical chemistry, so far, it has not been possible to reprogram the bacterial degradation machinery to interfere with microbial infections. Here, we develop small-molecule degraders, so-called BacPROTACs, that bind to the substrate receptor of the ClpC:ClpP protease, priming neo-substrates for degradation. In addition to their targeting function, BacPROTACs activate ClpC, transforming the resting unfoldase into its functional state. The induced higher-order oligomer was visualized by cryo-EM analysis, providing a structural snapshot of activated ClpC unfolding a protein substrate. Finally, drug susceptibility and degradation assays performed in mycobacteria demonstrate in vivo activity of BacPROTACs, allowing selective targeting of endogenous proteins via fusion to an established degron. In addition to guiding antibiotic discovery, the BacPROTAC technology presents a versatile research tool enabling the inducible degradation of bacterial proteins.

16,35660135,Exercise-induced engagement of the IL-15/IL-15Rα axis promotes anti-tumor immunity in pancreatic cancer - PubMed,"Abstract
        
      


      
      Aerobic exercise is associated with decreased cancer incidence and cancer-associated mortality. However, little is known about the effects of exercise on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), a disease for which current therapeutic options are limited. Herein, we show that aerobic exercise reduces PDA tumor growth, by modulating systemic and intra-tumoral immunity. Mechanistically, exercise promotes immune mobilization and accumulation of tumor-infiltrating IL15Rα+ CD8 T cells, which are responsible for the tumor-protective effects. In clinical samples, an exercise-dependent increase of intra-tumoral CD8 T cells is also observed. Underscoring the translational potential of the interleukin (IL)-15/IL-15Rα axis, IL-15 super-agonist (NIZ985) treatment attenuates tumor growth, prolongs survival, and enhances sensitivity to chemotherapy. Finally, exercise or NIZ985 both sensitize pancreatic tumors to αPD-1, with improved anti-tumor and survival benefits. Collectively, our findings highlight the therapeutic potential of an exercise-oncology axis and identify IL-15 activation as a promising treatment strategy for this deadly disease.

17,35661166,Teclistamab in Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma - PubMed,"Abstract
        
      



          Background:
        
      
      Teclistamab is a T-cell-redirecting bispecific antibody that targets both CD3 expressed on the surface of T cells and B-cell maturation antigen expressed on the surface of myeloma cells. In the phase 1 dose-defining portion of the study, teclistamab showed promising efficacy in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this phase 1-2 study, we enrolled patients who had relapsed or refractory myeloma after at least three therapy lines, including triple-class exposure to an immunomodulatory drug, a proteasome inhibitor, and an anti-CD38 antibody. Patients received a weekly subcutaneous injection of teclistamab (at a dose of 1.5 mg per kilogram of body weight) after receiving step-up doses of 0.06 mg and 0.3 mg per kilogram. The primary end point was the overall response (partial response or better).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Among 165 patients who received teclistamab, 77.8% had triple-class refractory disease (median, five previous therapy lines). With a median follow-up of 14.1 months, the overall response rate was 63.0%, with 65 patients (39.4%) having a complete response or better. A total of 44 patients (26.7%) were found to have no minimal residual disease (MRD); the MRD-negativity rate among the patients with a complete response or better was 46%. The median duration of response was 18.4 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 14.9 to not estimable). The median duration of progression-free survival was 11.3 months (95% CI, 8.8 to 17.1). Common adverse events included cytokine release syndrome (in 72.1% of the patients; grade 3, 0.6%; no grade 4), neutropenia (in 70.9%; grade 3 or 4, 64.2%), anemia (in 52.1%; grade 3 or 4, 37.0%), and thrombocytopenia (in 40.0%; grade 3 or 4, 21.2%). Infections were frequent (in 76.4%; grade 3 or 4, 44.8%). Neurotoxic events occurred in 24 patients (14.5%), including immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome in 5 patients (3.0%; all grade 1 or 2).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Teclistamab resulted in a high rate of deep and durable response in patients with triple-class-exposed relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Cytopenias and infections were common; toxic effects that were consistent with T-cell redirection were mostly grade 1 or 2.

18,35672400,Cardiac fibroblasts regulate the development of heart failure via Htra3-TGF-β-IGFBP7 axis - PubMed,"Abstract
        
      


      
      Tissue fibrosis and organ dysfunction are hallmarks of age-related diseases including heart failure, but it remains elusive whether there is a common pathway to induce both events. Through single-cell RNA-seq, spatial transcriptomics, and genetic perturbation, we elucidate that high-temperature requirement A serine peptidase 3 (Htra3) is a critical regulator of cardiac fibrosis and heart failure by maintaining the identity of quiescent cardiac fibroblasts through degrading transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β). Pressure overload downregulates expression of Htra3 in cardiac fibroblasts and activated TGF-β signaling, which induces not only cardiac fibrosis but also heart failure through DNA damage accumulation and secretory phenotype induction in failing cardiomyocytes. Overexpression of Htra3 in the heart inhibits TGF-β signaling and ameliorates cardiac dysfunction after pressure overload. Htra3-regulated induction of spatio-temporal cardiac fibrosis and cardiomyocyte secretory phenotype are observed specifically in infarct regions after myocardial infarction. Integrative analyses of single-cardiomyocyte transcriptome and plasma proteome in human reveal that IGFBP7, which is a cytokine downstream of TGF-β and secreted from failing cardiomyocytes, is the most predictable marker of advanced heart failure. These findings highlight the roles of cardiac fibroblasts in regulating cardiomyocyte homeostasis and cardiac fibrosis through the Htra3-TGF-β-IGFBP7 pathway, which would be a therapeutic target for heart failure.",{},{},{}
19,35672148,Microglial mTOR Activation Upregulates Trem2 and Enhances β-Amyloid Plaque Clearance in the 5XFAD Alzheimer's Disease Model - PubMed,"Abstract
        
      


      
      The mechanistic Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway plays a major role in key cellular processes including metabolism and differentiation; however, the role of mTOR in microglia and its importance in Alzheimer's disease (AD) has remained largely uncharacterized. We report that selective loss of Tsc1, a negative regulator of mTOR, in microglia in mice of both sexes, caused mTOR activation and upregulation of Trem2 with enhanced β-Amyloid clearance, reduced spine loss, and improved cognitive function in the 5XFAD AD mouse model. Combined loss of Tsc1 and Trem2 in microglia led to reduced β-Amyloid clearance and increased Aβ plaque burden revealing that Trem2 functions downstream of mTOR. Tsc1 mutant microglia showed increased phagocytosis with upregulation of CD68 and Lamp1 lysosomal proteins. In vitro studies using Tsc1-deficient microglia revealed enhanced endocytosis of the lysosomal tracker indicator Green DND-26 suggesting increased lysosomal activity. Incubation of Tsc1-deficient microglia with fluorescent-labeled Aβ revealed enhanced Aβ uptake and clearance, which was blunted by rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor. In vivo treatment of mice of relevant genotypes in the 5XFAD background with rapamycin, affected microglial activity, decreased Trem2 expression and reduced Aβ clearance causing an increase in Aβ plaque burden. Prolonged treatment with rapamycin caused even further reduction of mTOR activity, reduction in Trem2 expression, and increase in Aβ levels. Together, our findings reveal that mTOR signaling in microglia is critically linked to Trem2 regulation and lysosomal biogenesis, and that the up-regulation of Trem2 in microglia through mTOR activation could be exploited towards better therapeutic avenues to β-Amyloid-related AD pathologies.Significance statement:mTOR signaling pathway is a key regulator for major cellular metabolic processes. However, the link between mTOR signaling and AD is not well understood. In this study, we provide compelling in vivo evidence that mTOR activation in microglia would benefit β-Amyloid related AD pathologies, as it upregulates Trem2, a key receptor for β-Amyloid plaque uptake. Inhibition of mTOR pathway with rapamycin, a well-established immunosuppressant, downregulated Trem2 in microglia and reduced β-Amyloid plaque clearance indicating that mTOR inactivation may be detrimental in β-Amyloid-associated AD patients. This finding will have a significant public health impact and benefit, regarding the usage of rapamycin in AD patients, which we believe will aggravate the β-Amyloid-related AD pathologies.",{},{},{}
20,35668320,pH sensing controls tissue inflammation by modulating cellular metabolism and endo-lysosomal function of immune cells - PubMed,"Abstract
        
      


      
      Extracellular acidification occurs in inflamed tissue and the tumor microenvironment; however, a systematic study on how pH sensing contributes to tissue homeostasis is lacking. In the present study, we examine cell type-specific roles of the pH sensor G protein-coupled receptor 65 (GPR65) and its inflammatory disease-associated Ile231Leu-coding variant in inflammation control. GPR65 Ile231Leu knock-in mice are highly susceptible to both bacterial infection-induced and T cell-driven colitis. Mechanistically, GPR65 Ile231Leu elicits a cytokine imbalance through impaired helper type 17 T cell (TH17 cell) and TH22 cell differentiation and interleukin (IL)-22 production in association with altered cellular metabolism controlled through the cAMP-CREB-DGAT1 axis. In dendritic cells, GPR65 Ile231Leu elevates IL-12 and IL-23 release at acidic pH and alters endo-lysosomal fusion and degradation capacity, resulting in enhanced antigen presentation. The present study highlights GPR65 Ile231Leu as a multistep risk factor in intestinal inflammation and illuminates a mechanism by which pH sensing controls inflammatory circuits and tissue homeostasis.",{},{},{}
21,35672307,Serotonin and dopamine modulate aging in response to food odor and availability - PubMed,"Abstract
        
      


      
      An organism's ability to perceive and respond to changes in its environment is crucial for its health and survival. Here we reveal how the most well-studied longevity intervention, dietary restriction, acts in-part through a cell non-autonomous signaling pathway that is inhibited by the presence of attractive smells. Using an intestinal reporter for a key gene induced by dietary restriction but suppressed by attractive smells, we identify three compounds that block food odor effects in C. elegans, thereby increasing longevity as dietary restriction mimetics. These compounds clearly implicate serotonin and dopamine in limiting lifespan in response to food odor. We further identify a chemosensory neuron that likely perceives food odor, an enteric neuron that signals through the serotonin receptor 5-HT1A/SER-4, and a dopaminergic neuron that signals through the dopamine receptor DRD2/DOP-3. Aspects of this pathway are conserved in D. melanogaster. Thus, blocking food odor signaling through antagonism of serotonin or dopamine receptors is a plausible approach to mimic the benefits of dietary restriction.",{},{},{}
22,35654956,"Faulty autolysosome acidification in Alzheimer's disease mouse models induces autophagic build-up of Aβ in neurons, yielding senile plaques - PubMed","Abstract
        
      


      
      Autophagy is markedly impaired in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we reveal unique autophagy dysregulation within neurons in five AD mouse models in vivo and identify its basis using a neuron-specific transgenic mRFP-eGFP-LC3 probe of autophagy and pH, multiplex confocal imaging and correlative light electron microscopy. Autolysosome acidification declines in neurons well before extracellular amyloid deposition, associated with markedly lowered vATPase activity and build-up of Aβ/APP-βCTF selectively within enlarged de-acidified autolysosomes. In more compromised yet still intact neurons, profuse Aβ-positive autophagic vacuoles (AVs) pack into large membrane blebs forming flower-like perikaryal rosettes. This unique pattern, termed PANTHOS (poisonous anthos (flower)), is also present in AD brains. Additional AVs coalesce into peri-nuclear networks of membrane tubules where fibrillar β-amyloid accumulates intraluminally. Lysosomal membrane permeabilization, cathepsin release and lysosomal cell death ensue, accompanied by microglial invasion. Quantitative analyses confirm that individual neurons exhibiting PANTHOS are the principal source of senile plaques in amyloid precursor protein AD models.",{},{},{}

          Background:
        
      
      Prostate cancer is the most common noncutaneous cancer in American males. Causal links between dairy, or dietary calcium, and this cancer are considered suggestive but limited.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      To evaluate these associations in a large North American cohort, including many with no (or very low) dairy intake and much calcium from nondairy sources.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A prospective cohort study of 28,737 Seventh-day Adventist men in the United States and Canada, of whom 6389 were of black ethnicity. Diet was measured by FFQ, and 275 male participants also provided repeated 24-h dietary recalls as a calibration substudy. Incident cancers were mainly found by matching with cancer registries. Analyses used multivariable proportional hazards regressions and regression calibration for some analyses.
    


          Results:
        
      
      In total, 1254 (190 advanced) incident prostate cancer cases were found during an average 7.8 y of follow-up. Men at the 90th percentile of dairy intake (430 g/d) compared with the 10th percentile (20.2 g/d) had higher prostate cancer risk (HR: 1.27; 95% CI: 1.12, 1.43). Similar findings, comparing the same g/d intakes, were demonstrated for advanced prostate cancers (HR: 1.38; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.88), for nonadvanced cases (HR: 1.27; 95% CI: 1.11, 1.45), in black participants (HR: 1.24; 95% CI: 0.98, 1.58), and when excluding vegan participants (HR: 1.22; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.43). Calibrated dairy (g/d) regressions (all participants and all prostate cancers), adjusting for dietary measurement error, found a HR of 1.75 (95% CI: 1.32, 2.32). Comparing 90th percentile intake to zero intakes (uncalibrated), the HR was 1.62 (95% CI: 1.26, 2.05). There was no evidence of an effect of higher (905 mg/d) compared with lower (349 mg/d) intakes of nondairy calcium (HR: 1.16; 95% CI: 0.94, 1.44).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Men with higher intake of dairy foods, but not nondairy calcium, had a higher risk of prostate cancer compared with men having lower intakes. Associations were nonlinear, suggesting greatest increases in risk at relatively low doses.

      Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell malignancy that affects an increasing number of patients worldwide. Despite all the efforts to understand its pathogenesis and develop new treatment modalities, MM remains an incurable disease. Novel immunotherapies, such as CAR T cell therapy (CAR) and bispecific T cell engagers (BiTE), are intensively targeting different surface antigens, such as BMCA, SLAMF7 (CS1), GPRC5D, FCRH5 or CD38. However, stem cell transplantation is still indispensable in transplant-eligible patients. Studies suggest that the early use of immunotherapy may improve outcomes significantly. In this review, we summarize the currently available clinical literature on CAR and BiTE in MM. Furthermore, we will compare these two T cell-based immunotherapies and discuss potential therapeutic approaches to promote development of new clinical trials, using T cell-based immunotherapies, even as bridging therapies to a transplant.

          Background:
        
      
      In the MOVe-OUT trial, molnupiravir showed a clinically meaningful reduction in the risk for hospitalization or death in adults with mild to moderate COVID-19 and risk factors for progression to severe disease.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To identify other potential clinical benefits of molnupiravir versus placebo.
    


          Design:
        
      
      Secondary analysis of the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 component of MOVe-OUT. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04575597).

          Intervention:
        
      
      Molnupiravir, 800 mg, or placebo every 12 hours for 5 days.
    


          Measurements:
        
      
      Changes from baseline in C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration and oxygen saturation (Spo 2), need for respiratory interventions (including invasive mechanical ventilation), and need for medical services in all randomly assigned participants through day 29, and need for respiratory interventions and time to discharge in the subgroup of participants who were hospitalized after randomization.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Participants receiving molnupiravir showed faster normalization of CRP and Spo 2, with improvements observed on day 3 of therapy, compared with placebo. Molnupiravir-treated participants had a decreased need for respiratory interventions versus placebo-treated participants (relative risk reduction [RRR], 34.3% [95% CI, 4.3% to 54.9%]), with similar findings in participants who were hospitalized after randomization (RRR, 21.3% [CI, 0.2% to 38.0%]). Hospitalized participants who received molnupiravir were discharged a median of 3 days before those who received placebo. Acute care visits (7.2% vs. 10.6%; RRR, 32.1% [CI, 4.4% to 51.7%]) and COVID-19-related acute care visits (6.6% vs. 10.0%; RRR, 33.8% [CI, 5.6% to 53.6%]) were less frequent in molnupiravir- versus placebo-treated participants.
    


          Limitations:
        
      
      Some analyses were performed post hoc. Longer-term benefits of molnupiravir therapy were not evaluated. Participants were not immunized against SARS-CoV-2.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The findings suggest there are additional important clinical benefits of molnupiravir beyond reduction in hospitalization or death.

      Clonal expansions driven by somatic mutations become pervasive across human tissues with age, including in the haematopoietic system, where the phenomenon is termed clonal haematopoiesis1-4. The understanding of how and when clonal haematopoiesis develops, the factors that govern its behaviour, how it interacts with ageing and how these variables relate to malignant progression remains limited5,6. Here we track 697 clonal haematopoiesis clones from 385 individuals 55 years of age or older over a median of 13 years. We find that 92.4% of clones expanded at a stable exponential rate over the study period, with different mutations driving substantially different growth rates, ranging from 5% (DNMT3A and TP53) to more than 50% per year (SRSF2P95H). Growth rates of clones with the same mutation differed by approximately ±5% per year, proportionately affecting slow drivers more substantially. By combining our time-series data with phylogenetic analysis of 1,731 whole-genome sequences of haematopoietic colonies from 7 individuals from an older age group, we reveal distinct patterns of lifelong clonal behaviour. DNMT3A-mutant clones preferentially expanded early in life and displayed slower growth in old age, in the context of an increasingly competitive oligoclonal landscape. By contrast, splicing gene mutations drove expansion only later in life, whereas TET2-mutant clones emerged across all ages. Finally, we show that mutations driving faster clonal growth carry a higher risk of malignant progression. Our findings characterize the lifelong natural history of clonal haematopoiesis and give fundamental insights into the interactions between somatic mutation, ageing and clonal selection.",{},{},{}

          Background:
        
      
      Furmonertinib (AST2818) is an irreversible, selective, third-generation EGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitor. We aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of furmonertinib versus the first-generation EGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitor gefitinib as first-line treatment in patients with EGFR mutation-positive locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      The FURLONG study is a multicentre, double-blind, randomised, phase 3 study done in 55 hospitals across mainland China. We enrolled patients who were aged 18 years or older and had histologically confirmed, locally advanced or metastatic, stage IIIB, IIIC, or IV unresectable NSCLC with EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 Leu858Arg mutation on tissue biopsy confirmed by a central laboratory. Eligible patients were stratified according to EGFR mutation (exon 19 deletions or exon 21 Leu858Arg) and CNS metastases (with or without) and randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either oral furmonertinib (80 mg/day) or oral gefitinib (250 mg/day) in 21-day cycles until disease progression, the occurrence of intolerable toxicities, withdrawal of consent, or other discontinuation reasons judged by the investigators. Investigators, clinicians, participants, independent review centre (IRC) members, the sponsor, and those analysing the data were all masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was IRC-assessed progression-free survival and, along with safety, was analysed in the full analysis set, which comprised all randomly assigned patients who had received at least one dose of study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03787992, and is ongoing for survival follow-up.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      Between May 30, 2019, and Dec 5, 2019, 750 patients were screened, of whom 358 were randomly assigned to receive either furmonertinib and gefitinib-matching placebo (n=178) or gefitinib and furmonertinib-matching placebo (n=180). 178 patients randomly assigned to furmonertinib and 179 patients randomly assigned to gefitinib were treated and were included in the full analysis set. Median follow-up was 21·0 months (IQR 18·0-23·5) in the furmonertinib group and 21·0 months (18·0-23·5) in the gefitinib group. Median IRC-assessed progression-free survival was 20·8 months (95% CI 17·8-23·5) in the furmonertinib group and 11·1 months (9·7-12·5) in the gefitinib group (hazard ratio 0·44, 95% CI 0·34-0·58; p<0·0001). Treatment-related adverse events of a grade 3 or more occurred in 20 (11%) of 178 patients in the furmonertinib group and in 32 (18%) of 179 patients in the gefitinib group. Treatment-related serious adverse events were reported in ten (6%) patients in the furmonertinib group and in 11 (6%) patients in the gefitinib group. Ten (6%) patients in the furmonertinib group and three (2%) patients in the gefitinib group died due to adverse events, which were all judged to be possibly unrelated to study treatment by the investigators.
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      Furmonertinib showed superior efficacy compared with gefitinib as first-line therapy in Chinese patients with EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC, along with an acceptable safety profile without new signals. Furmonertinib is a new potential treatment option for this population.

      Alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) is a major cause of liver-related death worldwide, yet understanding of the three key pathological features of the disease-fibrosis, inflammation and steatosis-remains incomplete. Here, we present a paired liver-plasma proteomics approach to infer molecular pathophysiology and to explore the diagnostic and prognostic capability of plasma proteomics in 596 individuals (137 controls and 459 individuals with ALD), 360 of whom had biopsy-based histological assessment. We analyzed all plasma samples and 79 liver biopsies using a mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics workflow with short gradient times and an enhanced, data-independent acquisition scheme in only 3 weeks of measurement time. In plasma and liver biopsy tissues, metabolic functions were downregulated whereas fibrosis-associated signaling and immune responses were upregulated. Machine learning models identified proteomics biomarker panels that detected significant fibrosis (receiver operating characteristic-area under the curve (ROC-AUC), 0.92, accuracy, 0.82) and mild inflammation (ROC-AUC, 0.87, accuracy, 0.79) more accurately than existing clinical assays (DeLong's test, P < 0.05). These biomarker panels were found to be accurate in prediction of future liver-related events and all-cause mortality, with a Harrell's C-index of 0.90 and 0.79, respectively. An independent validation cohort reproduced the diagnostic model performance, laying the foundation for routine MS-based liver disease testing.",{},{},{}

          Background:
        
      
      Adagrasib, a KRASG12C inhibitor, irreversibly and selectively binds KRASG12C, locking it in its inactive state. Adagrasib showed clinical activity and had an acceptable adverse-event profile in the phase 1-1b part of the KRYSTAL-1 phase 1-2 study.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In a registrational phase 2 cohort, we evaluated adagrasib (600 mg orally twice daily) in patients with KRASG12C -mutated non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy and anti-programmed death 1 or programmed death ligand 1 therapy. The primary end point was objective response assessed by blinded independent central review. Secondary end points included the duration of response, progression-free survival, overall survival, and safety.
    


          Results:
        
      
      As of October 15, 2021, a total of 116 patients with KRASG12C -mutated NSCLC had been treated (median follow-up, 12.9 months); 98.3% had previously received both chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Of 112 patients with measurable disease at baseline, 48 (42.9%) had a confirmed objective response. The median duration of response was 8.5 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.2 to 13.8), and the median progression-free survival was 6.5 months (95% CI, 4.7 to 8.4). As of January 15, 2022 (median follow-up, 15.6 months), the median overall survival was 12.6 months (95% CI, 9.2 to 19.2). Among 33 patients with previously treated, stable central nervous system metastases, the intracranial confirmed objective response rate was 33.3% (95% CI, 18.0 to 51.8). Treatment-related adverse events occurred in 97.4% of the patients - grade 1 or 2 in 52.6% and grade 3 or higher in 44.8% (including two grade 5 events) - and resulted in drug discontinuation in 6.9% of patients.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      In patients with previously treated KRASG12C -mutated NSCLC, adagrasib showed clinical efficacy without new safety signals. (Funded by Mirati Therapeutics; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03785249.).",{},{},{}
33,35662414,Non-coding 7S RNA inhibits transcription via mitochondrial RNA polymerase dimerization - PubMed,"Abstract
        
      


      
      The mitochondrial genome encodes 13 components of the oxidative phosphorylation system, and altered mitochondrial transcription drives various human pathologies. A polyadenylated, non-coding RNA molecule known as 7S RNA is transcribed from a region immediately downstream of the light strand promoter in mammalian cells, and its levels change rapidly in response to physiological conditions. Here, we report that 7S RNA has a regulatory function, as it controls levels of mitochondrial transcription both in vitro and in cultured human cells. Using cryo-EM, we show that POLRMT dimerization is induced by interactions with 7S RNA. The resulting POLRMT dimer interface sequesters domains necessary for promoter recognition and unwinding, thereby preventing transcription initiation. We propose that the non-coding 7S RNA molecule is a component of a negative feedback loop that regulates mitochondrial transcription in mammalian cells.

34,35650442,Clonal dynamics of haematopoiesis across the human lifespan - PubMed,"Abstract
        
      


      
      Age-related change in human haematopoiesis causes reduced regenerative capacity1, cytopenias2, immune dysfunction3 and increased risk of blood cancer4-6, but the reason for such abrupt functional decline after 70 years of age remains unclear. Here we sequenced 3,579 genomes from single cell-derived colonies of haematopoietic cells across 10 human subjects from 0 to 81 years of age. Haematopoietic stem cells or multipotent progenitors (HSC/MPPs) accumulated a mean of 17 mutations per year after birth and lost 30 base pairs per year of telomere length. Haematopoiesis in adults less than 65 years of age was massively polyclonal, with high clonal diversity and a stable population of 20,000-200,000 HSC/MPPs contributing evenly to blood production. By contrast, haematopoiesis in individuals aged over 75 showed profoundly decreased clonal diversity. In each of the older subjects, 30-60% of haematopoiesis was accounted for by 12-18 independent clones, each contributing 1-34% of blood production. Most clones had begun their expansion before the subject was 40 years old, but only 22% had known driver mutations. Genome-wide selection analysis estimated that between 1 in 34 and 1 in 12 non-synonymous mutations were drivers, accruing at constant rates throughout life, affecting more genes than identified in blood cancers. Loss of the Y chromosome conferred selective benefits in males. Simulations of haematopoiesis, with constant stem cell population size and constant acquisition of driver mutations conferring moderate fitness benefits, entirely explained the abrupt change in clonal structure in the elderly. Rapidly decreasing clonal diversity is a universal feature of haematopoiesis in aged humans, underpinned by pervasive positive selection acting on many more genes than currently identified.",{},{},{}
35,35662412,Potent cross-reactive antibodies following Omicron breakthrough in vaccinees - PubMed,"Abstract
        
      


      
      Highly transmissible Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2 currently dominate globally. Here, we compare neutralization of Omicron BA.1, BA.1.1, and BA.2. BA.2 RBD has slightly higher ACE2 affinity than BA.1 and slightly reduced neutralization by vaccine serum, possibly associated with its increased transmissibility. Neutralization differences between sub-lineages for mAbs (including therapeutics) mostly arise from variation in residues bordering the ACE2 binding site; however, more distant mutations S371F (BA.2) and R346K (BA.1.1) markedly reduce neutralization by therapeutic antibody Vir-S309. In-depth structure-and-function analyses of 27 potent RBD-binding mAbs isolated from vaccinated volunteers following breakthrough Omicron-BA.1 infection reveals that they are focused in two main clusters within the RBD, with potent right-shoulder antibodies showing increased prevalence. Selection and somatic maturation have optimized antibody potency in less-mutated epitopes and recovered potency in highly mutated epitopes. All 27 mAbs potently neutralize early pandemic strains, and many show broad reactivity with variants of concern.

37,35659251,Barriers to following imaging guidelines for the treatment and management of patients with low-back pain in primary care: a qualitative assessment guided by the Theoretical Domains Framework - PubMed,"Abstract
        
      



          Background:
        
      
      Low back pain (LBP) is a leading cause of disability and is among the top five reasons that patients visit their family doctors. Over-imaging for non-specific low back pain remains a problem in primary care. To inform a larger study to develop and evaluate a theory-based intervention to reduce inappropriate imaging, we completed an assessment of the barriers and facilitators to reducing unnecessary imaging for NSLBP among family doctors in Newfoundland and Labrador (NL).
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This was an exploratory, qualitative study describing family doctors' experiences and practices related to diagnostic imaging for non-specific LBP in NL, guided by the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). Data were collected using in-depth, semi-structured interviews. Transcripts were analyzed deductively (assigning text to one or more domains) and inductively (generating themes at each of the domains) before the results were examined to determine which domains should be targeted to reduce imaging.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Nine family doctors (four males; five females) working in community (n = 4) and academic (n = 5) clinics in both rural (n = 6) and urban (n = 3) settings participated in this study. We found five barriers to reducing imaging for patients with NSLBP: 1) negative consequences, 2) patient demand 3) health system organization, 4) time, and 5) access to resources. These were related to the following domains: 1) beliefs about consequences, 2) beliefs about capabilities, 3) emotion, 4) reinforcement, 5) environmental context and resources, 6) social influences, and 7) behavioural regulation.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Family physicians a) fear that if they do not image they may miss something serious, b) face significant patient demand for imaging, c) are working in a system that encourages unnecessary imaging, d) don't have enough time to counsel patients about why they don't need imaging, and e) lack access to appropriate practitioners, community programs, and treatment modalities to prescribe to their patients. These barriers were related to seven TDF domains. Successfully reducing inappropriate imaging requires a comprehensive intervention that addresses these barriers using established behaviour change techniques. These techniques should be matched directly to relevant TDF domains. The results of our study represent the important first step of this process - identifying the contextual barriers and the domains to which they are related.

      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated disease of the central nervous system that causes demyelination, axonal degeneration and astrogliosis, resulting in progressive neurological disability. Fuelled by an evolving understanding of MS immunopathogenesis, the range of available immunotherapies for clinical use has expanded over the past two decades. However, MS remains an incurable disease and even targeted immunotherapies often fail to control insidious disease progression, indicating the need for new and exceptional therapeutic options beyond the established immunological landscape. In this Review, we highlight such non-canonical targets in preclinical MS research with a focus on five highly promising areas: oligodendrocytes; the blood-brain barrier; metabolites and cellular metabolism; the coagulation system; and tolerance induction. Recent findings in these areas may guide the field towards novel targets for future therapeutic approaches in MS.",{'Review': True},{},{}

41,35668454,The circadian clock protein Rev-erbα provides neuroprotection and attenuates neuroinflammation against Parkinson's disease via the microglial NLRP3 inflammasome - PubMed,"Abstract
        
      



          Background:
        
      
      Circadian disturbance is a common nonmotor complaint in Parkinson's disease (PD). The molecular basis underlying circadian rhythm in PD is poorly understood. Neuroinflammation has been identified as a key contributor to PD pathology. In this study, we explored the potential link between the core clock molecule Rev-erbα and the microglia-mediated NLR family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome in PD pathogenesis.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We first examined the diurnal Rev-erbα rhythms and diurnal changes in microglia-mediated inflammatory cytokines expression in the SN of MPTP-induced PD mice. Further, we used BV2 cell to investigate the impacts of Rev-erbα on NLRP3 inflammasome and microglial polarization induced by 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) and αsyn pre-formed fibril. The role of Rev-erbα in regulating microglial activation via NF-κB and NLRP3 inflammasome pathway was then explored. Effects of SR9009 against NLRP3 inflammasome activation, microgliosis and nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration in the SN and striatum of MPTP-induced PD mice were studied in detail.
    


          Results:
        
      
      BV2 cell-based experiments revealed the role of Rev-erbα in regulating microglial activation and polarization through the NF-κB and NLRP3 inflammasome pathways. Circadian oscillation of the core clock gene Rev-erbα in the substantia nigra (SN) disappeared in MPTP-induced PD mice, as well as diurnal changes in microglial morphology. The expression of inflammatory cytokines in SN of the MPTP-induced mice were significantly elevated. Furthermore, dopaminergic neurons loss in the nigrostriatal system were partially reversed by SR9009, a selective Rev-erbα agonist. In addition, SR9009 effectively reduced the MPTP-induced glial activation, microglial polarization and NLRP3 inflammasome activation in the nigrostriatal system.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      These observations suggest that the circadian clock protein Rev-erbα plays an essential role in attenuating neuroinflammation in PD pathology, and provides a potential therapeutic target for PD treatment.

42,35664061,Single-cell landscape reveals active cell subtypes and their interaction in the tumor microenvironment of gastric cancer - PubMed,"Abstract
        
      


Background: Gastric cancer remains the third most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide. The development of novel therapeutic strategies for gastric cancer requires a deep understanding of the tumor cells and microenvironment of gastric cancer. Methods: We performed the single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on nine untreated non-metastatic gastric cancer patients. The transcriptomic atlas and ligand-receptor-based intercellular communication networks of the single cells were characterized. Results: Here, we profiled the transcriptomes of 47,304 cells from nine patients with gastric cancer. Tregs cells were significantly enriched in the gastric tumor tissues with increased expression of immune suppression related genes, which suggest a more immunosuppressive microenvironment. We also observed the absence of separate exhausted CD8+ T cell cluster, and the low expression level of exhaustion markers PDCD1, CTLA4, HAVCR2, LAG-3, and TIGIT in those specific cells. These may serve as molecular-level evidence for the limited benefit of immunotherapy among gastric cancer patients. In addition, we found ACKR1 specifically expressed in tumor endothelial cells, associated with poor prognosis in the cohort data and potentially provided a novel target of gastric cancer treatment. Furthermore, the tight interaction between endothelial cells and fibroblast implied the important roles of fibroblast in tumor angiogenesis and the maintenance of tumor vasculature. Conclusions: In conclusion, this single-cell atlas provide understanding the cellular heterogeneity from molecular level in gastric cancer and will serve as a valuable resource for developing innovative early and companion diagnostics, as well as discovering novel targeted therapies for gastric cancer.

          Background:
        
      
      Contemporary data are needed about the utility of cannabinoids in chronic pain.
    


          Purpose:
        
      
      To evaluate the benefits and harms of cannabinoids for chronic pain.
    


          Data sources:
        
      
      Ovid MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and Scopus to January 2022.
    


          Study selection:
        
      
      English-language, randomized, placebo-controlled trials and cohort studies (≥1 month duration) of cannabinoids for chronic pain.
    


          Data extraction:
        
      
      Data abstraction, risk of bias, and strength of evidence assessments were dually reviewed. Cannabinoids were categorized by THC-to-CBD ratio (high, comparable, or low) and source (synthetic, extract or purified, or whole plant).
    


          Data synthesis:
        
      
      Eighteen randomized, placebo-controlled trials (n = 1740) and 7 cohort studies (n = 13 095) assessed cannabinoids. Studies were primarily short term (1 to 6 months); 56% enrolled patients with neuropathic pain, with 3% to 89% female patients. Synthetic products with high THC-to-CBD ratios (>98% THC) may be associated with moderate improvement in pain severity and response (≥30% improvement) and an increased risk for sedation and are probably associated with a large increased risk for dizziness. Extracted products with high THC-to-CBD ratios (range, 3:1 to 47:1) may be associated with large increased risk for study withdrawal due to adverse events and dizziness. Sublingual spray with comparable THC-to-CBD ratio (1.1:1) probably is associated with small improvement in pain severity and overall function and may be associated with large increased risk for dizziness and sedation and moderate increased risk for nausea. Evidence for other products and outcomes, including longer-term harms, were not reported or were insufficient.
    


          Limitation:
        
      
      Variation in interventions; lack of study details, including unclear availability in the United States; and inadequate evidence for some products.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Oral, synthetic cannabis products with high THC-to-CBD ratios and sublingual, extracted cannabis products with comparable THC-to-CBD ratios may be associated with short-term improvements in chronic pain and increased risk for dizziness and sedation. Studies are needed on long-term outcomes and further evaluation of product formulation effects.

44,35668045,A combination model of AD biomarkers revealed by machine learning precisely predicts Alzheimer's dementia: China Aging and Neurodegenerative Initiative (CANDI) study - PubMed,"Abstract
        
      



          Introduction:
        
      
      To test the utility of the ""A/T/N"" system in the Chinese population, we study core Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers in a newly established Chinese cohort.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A total of 411 participants were selected, including 96 cognitively normal individuals, 94 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, 173 patients with AD, and 48 patients with non-AD dementia. Fluid biomarkers were measured with single molecule array. Amyloid beta (Aβ) deposition was determined by 18 F-Flobetapir positron emission tomography (PET), and brain atrophy was quantified using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
    


          Results:
        
      
      Aβ42/Aβ40 was decreased, whereas levels of phosphorylated tau (p-tau) were increased in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma from patients with AD. CSF Aβ42/Aβ40, CSF p-tau, and plasma p-tau showed a high concordance in discriminating between AD and non-AD dementia or elderly controls. A combination of plasma p-tau, apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, and MRI measures accurately predicted amyloid PET status.
    


          Discussion:
        
      
      These results revealed a universal applicability of the ""A/T/N"" framework in a Chinese population and established an optimal diagnostic model consisting of cost-effective and non-invasive approaches for diagnosing AD.

45,35666518,Association Between Screen Time Trajectory and Early Childhood Development in Children in China - PubMed,"Abstract
        
      



          Importance:
        
      
      Screen time has become an integral part of children's daily lives. Nevertheless, the developmental consequences of screen exposure in young children remain unclear.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To investigate the screen time trajectory from 6 to 72 months of age and its association with children's development at age 72 months in a prospective birth cohort.
    


          Design, setting, and participants:
        
      
      Women in Shanghai, China, who were at 34 to 36 gestational weeks and had an expected delivery date between May 2012 and July 2013 were recruited for this cohort study. Their children were followed up at 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, and 72 months of age. Children's screen time was classified into 3 groups at age 6 months: continued low (ie, stable amount of screen time), late increasing (ie, sharp increase in screen time at age 36 months), and early increasing (ie, large amount of screen time in early stages that remained stable after age 36 months). Cognitive development was assessed by specially trained research staff in a research clinic. Of 262 eligible mother-offspring pairs, 152 dyads had complete data regarding all variables of interest and were included in the analyses. Data were analyzed from September 2019 to November 2021.
    


          Exposures:
        
      
      Mothers reported screen times of children at 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, and 72 months of age.
    


          Main outcomes and measures:
        
      
      The cognitive development of children was evaluated using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, 4th edition, at age 72 months. Social-emotional development was measured by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, which was completed by the child's mother. The study described demographic characteristics, maternal mental health, child's temperament at age 6 months, and mental development at age 12 months by subgroups clustered by a group-based trajectory model. Group difference was examined by analysis of variance.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 152 mother-offspring dyads were included in this study, including 77 girls (50.7%) and 75 boys (49.3%) (mean [SD] age of the mothers was 29.7 [3.3] years). Children's screen time trajectory from age 6 to 72 months was classified into 3 groups: continued low (110 [72.4%]), late increasing (17 [11.2%]), and early increasing (25 [16.4%]). Compared with the continued low group, the late increasing group had lower scores on the Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient (β coefficient, -8.23; 95% CI, -15.16 to -1.30; P < .05) and the General Ability Index (β coefficient, -6.42; 95% CI, -13.70 to 0.86; P = .08); the early increasing group presented with lower scores on the Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient (β coefficient, -6.68; 95% CI, -12.35 to -1.02; P < .05) and the Cognitive Proficiency Index (β coefficient, -10.56; 95% CI, -17.23 to -3.90; P < .01) and a higher total difficulties score (β coefficient, 2.62; 95% CI, 0.49-4.76; P < .05).
    


          Conclusions and relevance:
        
      
      This cohort study found that excessive screen time in early years was associated with poor cognitive and social-emotional development. This finding may be helpful in encouraging awareness among parents of the importance of onset and duration of children's screen time.",{},{},{}

      RNA-guided RNA-targeting nucleases, such as CRISPR-Cas13 proteins, have therapeutic potential for gene editing. Among Cas13d enzymes, Cas13d from the bacteria Ruminococcus flavefaciens (RfxCas13d) is of particular interest owing to its small size and high specificity. However, the existence of pre-existing immunity against RfxCas13d is unclear. In this study, we evaluated antibody and T cell responses to RfxCas13d in healthy donors using ELISA and T cell culture assays. We found RfxCas13d-reactive antibodies and CD4 and CD8 T cell responses in most donors, comparable to responses against Cas9 proteins from Staphylococcus aureus (SaCas9) and Streptococcus pyogenes (SpCas9). RfxCas13d-responding T cells could produce the inflammatory cytokines IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-17. These findings should be taken into consideration in the development of RfxCas13d for therapy.",{},{},{}

      Aberrant localization of proteins to mitochondria disturbs mitochondrial function and contributes to the pathogenesis of Huntington's disease (HD). However, the crucial factors and the molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we found that heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) accumulates in the mitochondria of HD cell models, a YAC128 mouse model, and human striatal organoids derived from HD induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Overexpression of mitochondria-targeting HSF1 (mtHSF1) in the striatum causes neurodegeneration and HD-like behavior in mice. Mechanistically, mtHSF1 facilitates mitochondrial fission by activating dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) phosphorylation at S616. Moreover, mtHSF1 suppresses single-stranded DNA-binding protein 1 (SSBP1) oligomer formation, which results in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletion. The suppression of HSF1 mitochondrial localization by DH1, a unique peptide inhibitor, abolishes HSF1-induced mitochondrial abnormalities and ameliorates deficits in an HD animal model and human striatal organoids. Altogether, our findings describe an unsuspected role of HSF1 in contributing to mitochondrial dysfunction, which may provide a promising therapeutic target for HD.

51,35654045,Gut bacterial isoamylamine promotes age-related cognitive dysfunction by promoting microglial cell death - PubMed,"Abstract
        
      


      
      The intestinal microbiome releases a plethora of small molecules. Here, we show that the Ruminococcaceae metabolite isoamylamine (IAA) is enriched in aged mice and elderly people, whereas Ruminococcaceae phages, belonging to the Myoviridae family, are reduced. Young mice orally administered IAA show cognitive decline, whereas Myoviridae phage administration reduces IAA levels. Mechanistically, IAA promotes apoptosis of microglial cells by recruiting the transcriptional regulator p53 to the S100A8 promoter region. Specifically, IAA recognizes and binds the S100A8 promoter region to facilitate the unwinding of its self-complementary hairpin structure, thereby subsequently enabling p53 to access the S100A8 promoter and enhance S100A8 expression. Thus, our findings provide evidence that small molecules released from the gut microbiome can directly bind genomic DNA and act as transcriptional coregulators by recruiting transcription factors. These findings further unveil a molecular mechanism that connects gut metabolism to gene expression in the brain with implications for disease development.

      The immune system is highly time-of-day dependent. Pioneering studies in the 1960s were the first to identify immune responses to be under a circadian control. Only in the last decade, however, have the molecular factors governing circadian immune rhythms been identified. These studies have revealed a highly complex picture of the interconnectivity of rhythmicity within immune cells with that of their environment.

      Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a growing cause of chronic liver disease. Using a proxy NAFLD definition of chronic elevation of alanine aminotransferase (cALT) levels without other liver diseases, we performed a multiancestry genome-wide association study (GWAS) in the Million Veteran Program (MVP) including 90,408 cALT cases and 128,187 controls. Seventy-seven loci exceeded genome-wide significance, including 25 without prior NAFLD or alanine aminotransferase associations, with one additional locus identified in European American-only and two in African American-only analyses (P < 5 × 10-8). External replication in histology-defined NAFLD cohorts (7,397 cases and 56,785 controls) or radiologic imaging cohorts (n = 44,289) replicated 17 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (P < 6.5 × 10-4), of which 9 were new (TRIB1, PPARG, MTTP, SERPINA1, FTO, IL1RN, COBLL1, APOH and IFI30). Pleiotropy analysis showed that 61 of 77 multiancestry and all 17 replicated SNPs were jointly associated with metabolic and/or inflammatory traits, revealing a complex model of genetic architecture. Our approach integrating cALT, histology and imaging reveals new insights into genetic liability to NAFLD.",{},{},{}
54,35659879,The spatiotemporal program of zonal liver regeneration following acute injury - PubMed,"Abstract
        
      


      
      The liver carries a remarkable ability to regenerate rapidly after acute zonal damage. Single-cell approaches are necessary to study this process, given the spatial heterogeneity of liver cell types. Here, we use spatially resolved single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to study the dynamics of mouse liver regeneration after acute acetaminophen (APAP) intoxication. We find that hepatocytes proliferate throughout the liver lobule, creating the mitotic pressure required to repopulate the necrotic pericentral zone rapidly. A subset of hepatocytes located at the regenerating front transiently upregulate fetal-specific genes, including Afp and Cdh17, as they reprogram to a pericentral state. Zonated endothelial, hepatic stellate cell (HSC), and macrophage populations are differentially involved in immune recruitment, proliferation, and matrix remodeling. We observe massive transient infiltration of myeloid cells, yet stability of lymphoid cell abundance, in accordance with a global decline in antigen presentation. Our study provides a resource for understanding the coordinated programs of zonal liver regeneration.

      Bidirectional signalling between the tumour and stroma shapes tumour aggressiveness and metastasis. ATF4 is a major effector of the Integrated Stress Response, a homeostatic mechanism that couples cell growth and survival to bioenergetic demands. Using conditional knockout ATF4 mice, we show that global, or fibroblast-specific loss of host ATF4, results in deficient vascularization and a pronounced growth delay of syngeneic melanoma and pancreatic tumours. Single-cell transcriptomics of tumours grown in Atf4Δ/Δ mice uncovered a reduction in activation markers in perivascular cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Atf4Δ/Δ fibroblasts displayed significant defects in collagen biosynthesis and deposition and a reduced ability to support angiogenesis. Mechanistically, ATF4 regulates the expression of the Col1a1 gene and levels of glycine and proline, the major amino acids of collagen. Analyses of human melanoma and pancreatic tumours revealed a strong correlation between ATF4 and collagen levels. Our findings establish stromal ATF4 as a key driver of CAF functionality, malignant progression and metastasis.",{},{},{}

      Post-stroke lateropulsion is prevalent. The global inconsistency in terminology used to describe the condition presents obstacles in accurately comparing research results, reaching consensus on use of measurement tools, agreeing upon a consistent approach to rehabilitation, and translating research to clinical practice. Commencing in 2021, 20 international experts undertook a Delphi Process that aimed to compile clinical practice recommendations for the rehabilitation of lateropulsion. As a part of the process, the panel agreed to aim to reach consensus regarding terminology used to describe the condition. Improved understanding of the condition could lead to improved management, which will enhance patient outcomes after stroke and increase efficiency of healthcare resource utilisation. While consensus was not reached, the panel achieved some agreement that 'lateropulsion' is the preferred term to describe the phenomenon of 'active pushing of the body across the midline toward the more affected side, and / or actively resisting weight shift toward the less affected side'. This group recommends that 'lateropulsion'is used in future research and in clinical practice.

          Purpose:
        
      
      CARTITUDE-1, a phase Ib/II study evaluating the safety and efficacy of ciltacabtagene autoleucel (cilta-cel) in heavily pretreated patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, yielded early, deep, and durable responses at 12 months. Here, we present updated results 2 years after last patient in (median follow-up [MFU] approximately 28 months), including analyses of high-risk patient subgroups.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Eligible patients had relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, had received ≥ 3 prior lines of therapy or were double refractory to a proteasome inhibitor and immunomodulatory drug and had received prior proteasome inhibitor, immunomodulatory drug, and anti-CD38 therapy. Patients received a single cilta-cel infusion 5-7 days after lymphodepletion. Responses were assessed by an independent review committee.
    


          Results:
        
      
      At a MFU of 27.7 months (N = 97), the overall response rate was 97.9% (95% CI, 92.7 to 99.7); 82.5% (95% CI, 73.4 to 89.4) of patients achieved a stringent complete response. Median duration of response was not estimable. Median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were not reached; 27-month PFS and OS rates were 54.9% (95% CI, 44.0 to 64.6) and 70.4% (95% CI, 60.1 to 78.6), respectively. Overall response rates were high across all subgroups (95.1%-100%). Duration of response, PFS, and/or OS were shorter in patients with high-risk cytogenetics, International Staging System stage III, high tumor burden, or plasmacytomas. The safety profile was manageable with no new cilta-cel-related cytokine release syndrome and one new case of parkinsonism (day 914 after cilta-cel) since the last report.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      At approximately 28 months MFU, patients treated with cilta-cel maintained deep and durable responses, observed in both standard and high-risk subgroups. The risk/benefit profile of cilta-cel remained favorable with longer follow-up.",{},{},{}
58,35666872,ZBP1 promotes inflammatory responses downstream of TLR3/TLR4 via timely delivery of RIPK1 to TRIF - PubMed,"Abstract
        
      


      
      SignificanceWhile ZBP1 is well documented to drive cell death in response to viruses, its role in the context of Toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated immune activation remains less defined. Here, we show that ZBP1 promotes inflammation in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). In a dose dependent manner, ZBP1 promotes the recruitment of RIPK1 to the TLR3/4 adaptor TRIF, activating downstream inflammatory signaling. ZBP1 plays a crucial role in TRIF-dependent responses in vivo, as Zbp1-/- mice exhibited resistance to LPS-induced hypothermia and attenuated inflammatory responses to dsRNA. Our findings suggest that ZBP1 plays a synergistic role in the immune response by driving inflammation downstream of TLRs in response to bacterial and viral components.

      Brexucabtagene autoleucel (KTE-X19) autologous anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy is approved for the treatment of relapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). Outcomes after a 3-year follow-up in the pivotal ZUMA-2 study of KTE-X19 in relapsed/refractory MCL are reported, including for subgroups by prior therapy (bendamustine and type of Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor [BTKi]) or high-risk characteristics.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Patients with relapsed/refractory MCL (one to five prior therapies, including prior BTKi exposure) received a single infusion of KTE-X19 (2 × 106 CAR T cells/kg).
    


          Results:
        
      
      After a median follow-up of 35.6 months, the objective response rate among all 68 treated patients was 91% (95% CI, 81.8 to 96.7) with 68% complete responses (95% CI, 55.2 to 78.5); medians for duration of response, progression-free survival, and overall survival were 28.2 months (95% CI, 13.5 to 47.1), 25.8 months (95% CI, 9.6 to 47.6), and 46.6 months (95% CI, 24.9 to not estimable), respectively. Post hoc analyses showed that objective response rates and ongoing response rates were consistent among prespecified subgroups by prior BTKi exposure or high-risk characteristics. In an exploratory analysis, patients with prior bendamustine benefited from KTE-X19, but showed a trend toward attenuated T-cell functionality, with more impact of bendamustine given within 6 versus 12 months of leukapheresis. Late-onset toxicities were infrequent; only 3% of treatment-emergent adverse events of interest in ZUMA-2 occurred during this longer follow-up period. Translational assessments revealed associations with long-term benefits of KTE-X19 including high-peak CAR T-cell expansion in responders and the predictive value of minimal residual disease for relapse.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      These data, representing the longest follow-up of CAR T-cell therapy in patients with MCL to date, suggest that KTE-X19 induced durable long-term responses with manageable safety in patients with relapsed/refractory MCL and may also benefit those with high-risk characteristics.",{},{},{}
60,35662396,Itaconate is a lysosomal inducer that promotes antibacterial innate immunity - PubMed,"Abstract
        
      


      
      Lysosomes are the main organelles in macrophages for killing invading bacteria. However, the precise mechanism underlying lysosomal biogenesis upon bacterial infection remains enigmatic. We demonstrate here that LPS stimulation increases IRG1-dependent itaconate production, which promotes lysosomal biogenesis by activating the transcription factor, TFEB. Mechanistically, itaconate directly alkylates human TFEB at cysteine 212 (Cys270 in mice) to induce its nuclear localization by antagonizing mTOR-mediated phosphorylation and cytosolic retention. Functionally, abrogation of itaconate synthesis by IRG1/Irg1 knockout or expression of an alkylation-deficient TFEB mutant impairs the antibacterial ability of macrophages in vitro. Furthermore, knockin mice harboring an alkylation-deficient TFEB mutant display elevated susceptibility to Salmonella typhimurium infection, whereas in vivo treatment of OI, a cell-permeable itaconate derivative, limits inflammation. Our study identifies itaconate as an endogenous metabolite that functions as a lysosomal inducer in macrophages in response to bacterial infection, implying the potential therapeutic utility of itaconate in treating human bacterial infection.

      Mucins are large gel-forming polymers inside the mucus barrier that inhibit the yeast-to-hyphal transition of Candida albicans, a key virulence trait of this important human fungal pathogen. However, the molecular motifs in mucins that inhibit filamentation remain unclear despite their potential for therapeutic interventions. Here, we determined that mucins display an abundance of virulence-attenuating molecules in the form of mucin O-glycans. We isolated and cataloged >100 mucin O-glycans from three major mucosal surfaces and established that they suppress filamentation and related phenotypes relevant to infection, including surface adhesion, biofilm formation and cross-kingdom competition between C. albicans and the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Using synthetic O-glycans, we identified three structures (core 1, core 1 + fucose and core 2 + galactose) that are sufficient to inhibit filamentation with potency comparable to the complex O-glycan pool. Overall, this work identifies mucin O-glycans as host molecules with untapped therapeutic potential to manage fungal pathogens.",{},{},{}

      A multi-country outbreak of the monkeypox virus has gained global attention. As of 25 May, 250 confirmed human monkeypox cases have been reported globally. Monkeypox is caused by the Monkeypox virus, which belongs to the Orthopoxvirus genus and Poxviridae family. Monkeypox is often a self-limiting infection, with symptoms lasting 2 to 4 weeks with the case fatality ratio around 3-6%. Monkeypox is transmitted to humans by direct contact with an infected person or animal or contact with virus-contaminated material. Human monkeypox infections may lead to various medical complications such as fever, rash, and lymphadenopathies. Pneumonitis, encephalitis, sight-threatening keratitis, and subsequent bacterial infections are all possible complications of monkeypox. An antiviral agent developed to treat smallpox has also been approved for use in the treatment of monkeypox in the USA. Vaccines used in the smallpox eradication program also provided immunity to monkeypox. Newer vaccines have been developed, one of which has been approved for monkeypox prevention. In this article, we provide information about the recent outbreaks of human monkeypox, epidemiology, transmission pattern, possible diagnosis techniques, therapeutics, and available preventive strategies.

          Background:
        
      
      Multiple lines of evidence have demonstrated that circular RNAs (circRNAs) play oncogenic or tumor-suppressive roles in various human cancers. Nevertheless, the biological functions of circRNAs in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) are still elusive.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      CircVAPA (annotated as hsa_circ_0006990) was identified by mining the circRNA profiling dataset of six paired SCLC tissues and the RNA-seq data of serum samples from 36 SCLC patients and 118 healthy controls. The circVAPA expression level was evaluated using quantitative real-time PCR in SCLC cells and tissues. Cell viability, colony formation, cell cycle and apoptosis analysis assays and in vivo tumorigenesis were used to reveal the biological roles of circVAPA. The underlying mechanism of circVAPA was investigated by Western blot, RNA pulldown, RNA immunoprecipitation, dual-luciferase reporter assay and rescue experiments.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We revealed that circVAPA, derived from exons 2-4 of the vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein A (VAPA) gene, exhibited higher expression levels in SCLC cell lines, clinical tissues, and serum from SCLC patients than the controls, and facilitated SCLC progression in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, circVAPA activated the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathway by modulating the miR-377-3p and miR-494-3p/insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) axis to accelerate SCLC progression. Furthermore, circVAPA depletion markedly enhanced the inhibitory effects of BMS-536924, an IGF1R kinase inhibitor in cellular and xenograft mouse models.

      CircVAPA promotes SCLC progression via the miR-377-3p and miR-494-3p/IGF1R/AKT axis. We hope to develop clinical protocols of combinations of circVAPA inhibition and BMS-536924 addition for treating SCLC with circVAPA upregulation.

Mice that received two-dose WT LNP-mRNA show a > 40-fold reduction in neutralization potency against Omicron than WT two weeks post boost, which further reduce to background level after 3 months. The WT or Omicron LNP-mRNA booster increases the waning antibody response of WT LNP-mRNA vaccinated mice against Omicron by 40 fold at two weeks post injection. Interestingly, the heterologous Omicron booster elicits neutralizing titers 10-20 fold higher than the homologous WT booster against Omicron variant, with comparable titers against Delta variant. All three types of vaccination, including Omicron alone, WT booster and Omicron booster, elicit broad binding antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 WA-1, Beta, Delta variants and SARS-CoV. These data provide direct assessments of an Omicron-specific mRNA vaccination in vivo, both alone and as a heterologous booster to WT mRNA vaccine.",{},"{'Animals': True, 'Antibodies, Neutralizing': True, 'Antibodies, Viral': True, 'COVID-19 Vaccines': True, 'COVID-19* / prevention & control': True, 'Liposomes': True, 'Mice': True, 'Nanoparticles': True, 'RNA, Messenger / genetics': True, 'SARS-CoV-2* / genetics': True, 'Vaccination': True, 'Vaccines, Synthetic': True, 'mRNA Vaccines': True}","{'Antibodies, Neutralizing': True, 'Antibodies, Viral': True, 'COVID-19 Vaccines': True, 'Lipid Nanoparticles': True, 'Liposomes': True, 'RNA, Messenger': True, 'Vaccines, Synthetic': True, 'mRNA Vaccine': True, 'mRNA Vaccines': True}"
68,35655235,Acute cardiac side effects after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination: a case series - PubMed,"Abstract
        
      



          Background:
        
      
      Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 has been the main tool to contain the pandemic. The rush development of the 3 vaccines and their expedited approval have led to inoculation of millions of patients around the world, leading to a containment of the disease. Despite continuous viral mutations and the identification of weaker variants, the severity of the infections has been mild, with many patients being either asymptomatic or recovering at home. Currently the focus has shifted from the host of organ damage related to the infection to potential side effects of the vaccine. Myocarditis has been reported as one of the potential side effects from the mRNA vaccine, affecting young healthy individuals. Up to September 30, 2021, 1.243 cases of myocarditis after vaccination with BNT162b2 Comirnaty© were registered in young adults by the Paul-Ehrlich-Institute in Germany alone. The exact pathophysiology and the risk factors for myocarditis following vaccination remain unclear. We present a case series of eight patients with cardiac symptom shortly after SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination (BNT162b6, Biontech, Comirnaty© or mRNA-1237 Moderna, Spikevax©).
    


          Patients and methods:
        
      
      Eight patients between 13 and 56 years of age, vaccinated with either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 mRNA vaccine between January and August 2021 developed cardiac side effects shortly after either their first or second dose of the vaccine. Clinical data were retrieved from the clinical information system and analyzed. To support diagnosis of myocarditis or pericarditis, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed shortly after the onset of symptoms, with further investigations in severe cases. Symptoms were defined as dyspnea, chest pain and cardiac arrhythmia as determined by electrocardiography.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Eight patients (5 males and 3 females) developed cardiac symptoms compatible with myocarditis, according to the CDC criteria, shortly after SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination. Three patients (2 males, 1 female) required hospitalization due to severe chest pain and elevated troponin levels. All patients recovered fully within 7 days from the symptom onset.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Our data suggest that cardiac adverse events such as myocarditis or pericarditis shortly after SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination are rare but possible and occur particularly in male patients.

69,35666982,High Levels of Circulating Tumor Plasma Cells as a Key Hallmark of Aggressive Disease in Transplant-Eligible Patients With Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma - PubMed,"Abstract
        
      



          Purpose:
        
      
      High levels of circulating tumor plasma cells (CTC-high) in patients with multiple myeloma are a marker of aggressive disease. We aimed to confirm the prognostic impact and identify a possible cutoff value of CTC-high for the prediction of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), in the context of concomitant risk features and minimal residual disease (MRD) achievement.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      CTC were analyzed at diagnosis with two-tube single-platform flow cytometry (sensitivity 4 × 10-5) in patients enrolled in the multicenter randomized FORTE clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02203643). MRD was assessed by second-generation multiparameter flow cytometry (sensitivity 10-5). We tested different cutoff values in series of multivariate (MV) Cox proportional hazards regression analyses on PFS outcome and selected the value that maximized the Harrell's C-statistic. We analyzed the impact of CTC on PFS and OS in a MV analysis including baseline features and MRD negativity.
    


          Results:
        
      
      CTC analysis was performed in 401 patients; the median follow-up was 50 months (interquartile range, 45-54 months). There was a modest correlation between the percentage of CTC and bone marrow plasma cells (r = 0.38). We identified an optimal CTC cutoff of 0.07% (approximately 5 cells/µL, C-index 0.64). In MV analysis, CTC-high versus CTC-low patients had significantly shorter PFS (hazard ratio, 2.61; 95% CI, 1.49 to 2.97, P < .001; 4-year PFS 38% v 69%) and OS (hazard ratio, 2.61; 95% CI, 1.49 to 4.56; P < .001; 4-year OS 68% v 92%). The CTC levels, but not the bone marrow plasma cell levels, affected the outcome. The only factor that reduced the negative impact of CTC-high was the achievement of MRD negativity (interaction P = .039).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      In multiple myeloma, increasing levels of CTC above an optimal cutoff represent an easy-to-assess, robust, and independent high-risk factor. The achievement of MRD negativity is the most important factor that modulates their negative prognostic impact.",{},{},{}

      Hyperglycemia-associated advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and the receptor for AGE (RAGE) contribute to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Xanthohumol (XH) exhibits protective activities against liver diseases. Aim: To investigate the effects of XH on Type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM)-induced liver steatosis and fibrosis. Methods: NAFLD rat models were duplicated. Biomolecular markers were detected. Quantitative real-time PCR (RT-PCR) and western blot were used to detect mRNA and protein expression. Immunofluorescence assays were employed to identify the subcellular locations. Results: XH significantly ameliorated hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia in rats. XH attenuated the expression of RAGE and NF-κB signaling. XH significantly alleviated inflammation and oxidation by upregulating NRF2 expression. Knockdown of NRF2 blocked XH protection in hepatocytes. Conclusion: XH protected against T2DM-induced liver steatosis and fibrosis by mediating NRF2/AGE/RAGE/NF-κB signaling.

      Chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy has improved the treatment of certain solid tumors, but effective regimens remain elusive for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We conducted a randomized phase 2 trial evaluating the efficacy of nivolumab (nivo; anti-PD-1) and/or sotigalimab (sotiga; CD40 agonistic antibody) with gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel (chemotherapy) in patients with first-line metastatic PDAC ( NCT03214250 ). In 105 patients analyzed for efficacy, the primary endpoint of 1-year overall survival (OS) was met for nivo/chemo (57.7%, P = 0.006 compared to historical 1-year OS of 35%, n = 34) but was not met for sotiga/chemo (48.1%, P = 0.062, n = 36) or sotiga/nivo/chemo (41.3%, P = 0.223, n = 35). Secondary endpoints were progression-free survival, objective response rate, disease control rate, duration of response and safety. Treatment-related adverse event rates were similar across arms. Multi-omic circulating and tumor biomarker analyses identified distinct immune signatures associated with survival for nivo/chemo and sotiga/chemo. Survival after nivo/chemo correlated with a less suppressive tumor microenvironment and higher numbers of activated, antigen-experienced circulating T cells at baseline. Survival after sotiga/chemo correlated with greater intratumoral CD4 T cell infiltration and circulating differentiated CD4 T cells and antigen-presenting cells. A patient subset benefitting from sotiga/nivo/chemo was not identified. Collectively, these analyses suggest potential treatment-specific correlates of efficacy and may enable biomarker-selected patient populations in subsequent PDAC chemoimmunotherapy trials.",{},{},{}
72,35668064,STAT6 inhibits ferroptosis and alleviates acute lung injury via regulating P53/SLC7A11 pathway - PubMed,"Abstract
        
      


      
      Compelling evidences have revealed the emerging role of ferroptosis in the pathophysiological process of acute lung injury (ALI), but its modulation is not clear. Here, we identified that STAT6 acted as a critical regulator of epithelium ferroptosis during ALI. Firstly, STAT6 expression and activity were increased in the ALI mice models caused by crystalline silica (CS), LPS and X-ray exposure. Followed by confirming the contribution of ferroptosis in the above ALI with ferrostatin-1 and deferoxamine intervention, bioinformatic analyses revealed that STAT6 expression was negatively correlated with ferroptosis. Consistently, lung epithelium-specific depletion of STAT6 in mice or STAT6 knockdown in cultured epithelial cells exacerbated ferroptosis in the above ALI. While overexpression of STAT6 in lung epithelial cells attenuated the ferroptosis. Mechanistically, SLC7A11 is a typical ferroptosis-related gene and negatively regulated by P53. CREB-binding protein (CBP) is a critical acetyltransferase of P53 acetylation, showing valuable regulation on targets' transcription. Herein, we found that STAT6 negatively regulates ferroptosis through competitively binding with CBP, which inhibits P53 acetylation and transcriptionally restores SLC7A11 expression. Finally, pulmonary-specific STAT6 overexpression decreased the ferroptosis and attenuated CS and LPS induced lung injury. Our findings revealed that STAT6 is a pivotal regulator of ferroptosis, which may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of acute lung injury.",{},"{'Acute Lung Injury* / chemically induced': True, 'Acute Lung Injury* / genetics': True, 'Animals': True, 'Ferroptosis*': True, 'Lipopolysaccharides / pharmacology': True, 'Mice': True, 'Mice, Inbred C57BL': True, 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2 / metabolism': True, 'STAT6 Transcription Factor / genetics': True, 'STAT6 Transcription Factor / metabolism': True, 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 / genetics': True}","{'Lipopolysaccharides': True, 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2': True, 'STAT6 Transcription Factor': True, 'Stat6 protein, mouse': True, 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53': True}"
73,35669791,Single-Cell Transcriptomics Revealed Subtype-Specific Tumor Immune Microenvironments in Human Glioblastomas - PubMed,"Abstract
        
      


      
      Human glioblastoma (GBM), the most aggressive brain tumor, comprises six major subtypes of malignant cells, giving rise to both inter-patient and intra-tumor heterogeneity. The interaction between different tumor subtypes and non-malignant cells to collectively shape a tumor microenvironment has not been systematically characterized. Herein, we sampled the cellular milieu of surgically resected primary tumors from 7 GBM patients using single-cell transcriptome sequencing. A lineage relationship analysis revealed that a neural-progenitor-2-like (NPC2-like) state with high metabolic activity was associated with the tumor cells of origin. Mesenchymal-1-like (MES1-like) and mesenchymal-2-like (MES2-like) tumor cells correlated strongly with immune infiltration and chronic hypoxia niche responses. We identified four subsets of tumor-associated macrophages/microglia (TAMs), among which TAM-1 co-opted both acute and chronic hypoxia-response signatures, implicated in tumor angiogenesis, invasion, and poor prognosis. MES-like GBM cells expressed the highest number of M2-promoting ligands compared to other cellular states while all six states were associated with TAM M2-type polarization and immunosuppression via a set of 10 ligand-receptor signaling pathways. Our results provide new insights into the differential roles of GBM cell subtypes in the tumor immune microenvironment that may be deployed for patient stratification and personalized treatment.

74,35666040,Does first-line treatment have prognostic impact for unresectable HCC?-Atezolizumab plus bevacizumab versus lenvatinib - PubMed,"Abstract
        
      



          Background/aim:
        
      
      A comparison of therapeutic efficacy between atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (Atez/Bev) and lenvatinib treatment given as first-line therapy for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (u-HCC) in regard to progression-free survival (PFS) overall survival (OS) has not been reported. We aimed to elucidate which of those given as initial treatment for u-HCC has greater prognostic impact on PFS and OS of affected patients, retrospectively.
    


          Materials/methods:
        
      
      From 2020 to January 2022, 251 u-HCC (Child-Pugh A, ECOG PS 0/1, BCLC-B/C) treated were enrolled (Atez/Bev-group, n = 194; lenvatinib-group, n = 57). PFS and OS were analyzed following adjustment based on inverse probability weighting (IPW).
    


          Results:
        
      
      There was a greater number of patients with macro-vascular invasion in Atez/Bev-group (22.7% vs. 8.8%, p = 0.022). In lenvatinib-group, the frequencies of appetite loss (38.6% vs. 19.6%, p = 0.002), hypothyroidism (21.1% vs. 6.7%, p = 0.004), hand foot skin reaction (19.3% vs. 1.0%, p < 0.001), and diarrhea (10.5% vs. 4.6%, p = 0.012) were greater, while that of general fatigue was lower (22.8% vs. 26.3%, p = 0.008). Comparisons of therapeutic best response using modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (mRECIST) did not show significant differences between the present groups (Atez/Bev vs. lenvatinib: CR/PR/SD/PD = 6.1%/39.1%/39.1%/15.6% vs. 0%/48.0%/38.0%/14.0%, p = 0.285). In patients of discontinuation of treatments, 48.2% switched to lenvatinib, 10.6% continued beyond PD, 8.2% received another systemic treatment, 5.9% underwent transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE), 3.5% received hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC), and 1.2% underwent surgical resection in Atez/Bev-group, while 42.2% switched to Atez/Bev, 4.4% continued beyond PD, 4.4% received another systemic treatment, 2.2% nivolumab, 6.7% received TACE, and 2.2% received HAIC in lenvatinib-group. Following adjustment with inverse probability weighting (IPW), Atez/Bev-group showed better PFS (0.5-/1-/1.5-years: 56.6%/31.6%/non-estimable vs. 48.6%/20.4%/11.2%, p < 0.0001) and OS rates (0.5-/1-/1.5-years: 89.6%/67.2%/58.1% vs. 77.8%/66.2%/52.7%, p = 0.002).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      The present study showed that u-HCC patients who received Atez/Bev as a first-line treatment may have a better prognosis than those who received lenvatinib.

75,35670107,TRIM27 cooperates with STK38L to inhibit ULK1-mediated autophagy and promote tumorigenesis - PubMed,"Abstract
        
      


      
      Autophagy represents a fundamental mechanism for maintaining cell survival and tissue homeostasis in response to physiological and pathological stress. Autophagy initiation converges on the FIP200-ATG13-ULK1 complex wherein the serine/threonine kinase ULK1 plays a central role. Here, we reveal that the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM27 functions as a negative regulatory component of the FIP200-ATG13-ULK1 complex. TRIM27 directly polyubiquitinates ULK1 at K568 and K571 sites with K48-linked ubiquitin chains, with proteasomal turnover maintaining control over basal ULK1 levels. However, during starvation-induced autophagy, TRIM27 catalyzes non-degradative K6- and K11-linked ubiquitination of the serine/threonine kinase 38-like (STK38L) kinase. In turn, STK38L ubiquitination promotes its activation and phosphorylation of ULK1 at Ser495, rendering ULK1 in a permissive state for TRIM27-mediated hyper-ubiquitination of ULK1. This cooperative mechanism serves to restrain the amplitude and duration of autophagy. Further evidence from mouse models shows that basal autophagy levels are increased in Trim27 knockout mice and that Trim27 differentially regulates tumorigenesis and metastasis. Our study identifies a key role of STK38L-TRIM27-ULK1 signaling axis in negatively controlling autophagy with relevance established in human breast cancer.

76,35657320,Circulating Tumor DNA Analysis Guiding Adjuvant Therapy in Stage II Colon Cancer - PubMed,"Abstract
        
      



          Background:
        
      
      The role of adjuvant chemotherapy in stage II colon cancer continues to be debated. The presence of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) after surgery predicts very poor recurrence-free survival, whereas its absence predicts a low risk of recurrence. The benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy for ctDNA-positive patients is not well understood.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We conducted a trial to assess whether a ctDNA-guided approach could reduce the use of adjuvant chemotherapy without compromising recurrence risk. Patients with stage II colon cancer were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to have treatment decisions guided by either ctDNA results or standard clinicopathological features. For ctDNA-guided management, a ctDNA-positive result at 4 or 7 weeks after surgery prompted oxaliplatin-based or fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy. Patients who were ctDNA-negative were not treated. The primary efficacy end point was recurrence-free survival at 2 years. A key secondary end point was adjuvant chemotherapy use.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of the 455 patients who underwent randomization, 302 were assigned to ctDNA-guided management and 153 to standard management. The median follow-up was 37 months. A lower percentage of patients in the ctDNA-guided group than in the standard-management group received adjuvant chemotherapy (15% vs. 28%; relative risk, 1.82; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.25 to 2.65). In the evaluation of 2-year recurrence-free survival, ctDNA-guided management was noninferior to standard management (93.5% and 92.4%, respectively; absolute difference, 1.1 percentage points; 95% CI, -4.1 to 6.2 [noninferiority margin, -8.5 percentage points]). Three-year recurrence-free survival was 86.4% among ctDNA-positive patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy and 92.5% among ctDNA-negative patients who did not.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      A ctDNA-guided approach to the treatment of stage II colon cancer reduced adjuvant chemotherapy use without compromising recurrence-free survival.

77,35659337,Leucine-tRNA-synthase-2-expressing B cells contribute to colorectal cancer immunoevasion - PubMed,"Abstract
        
      


      
      Immunoregulatory B cells impede antitumor immunity through unknown features and mechanisms. We report the existence of leucine-tRNA-synthase-2 (LARS2)-expressing B cell (LARS B) subset with a transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1)-dominant regulatory feature in both mouse and human progressive colorectal cancer (CRC). Of note, LARS B cells exhibited a leucine nutrient preference and displayed active mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis. They were located outside the tertiary lymphoid structure and correlated with colorectal hyperplasia and shortened survival in CRC patients. A leucine diet induced LARS B cell generation, whereas LARS B cell deletion by Lars2 gene ablation or leucine blockage repressed CRC immunoevasion. Mechanistically, LARS2 programmed mitochondrial nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) regeneration and oxidative metabolism, thus determining the regulatory feature of LARS B cells in which the NAD-dependent protein deacetylase sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) was involved. We propose a leucine-dieting scheme to inhibit LARS B cells, which is safe and useful for CRC therapy.

78,35658976,Tet2 deficiency drives liver microbiome dysbiosis triggering Tc1 cell autoimmune hepatitis - PubMed,"Abstract
        
      


      
      The triggers that drive interferon-γ (IFNγ)-producing CD8 T cell (Tc1 cell)-mediated autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) remain obscure. Here, we show that lack of hematopoietic Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 (Tet2), an epigenetic regulator associated with autoimmunity, results in the development of microbiota-dependent AIH-like pathology, accompanied by hepatic enrichment of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) ligand-producing pathobionts and rampant Tc1 cell immunity. We report that AIH-like disease development is dependent on both IFNγ and AhR signaling, as blocking either reverts ongoing AIH-like pathology. Illustrating the critical role of AhR-ligand-producing pathobionts in this condition, hepatic translocation of the AhR ligand indole-3-aldehyde (I3A)-releasing Lactobacillus reuteri is sufficient to trigger AIH-like pathology. Finally, we demonstrate that I3A is required for L. reuteri-induced Tc1 cell differentiation in vitro and AIH-like pathology in vivo, both of which are restrained by Tet2 within CD8 T cells. This AIH-disease model may contribute to the development of therapeutics to alleviate AIH.

      Autosomal recessive IRF7 deficiency was previously reported in three patients with single critical influenza or COVID-19 pneumonia episodes. The patients' fibroblasts and plasmacytoid dendritic cells produced no detectable type I and III IFNs, except IFN-β. Having discovered four new patients, we describe the genetic, immunological, and clinical features of seven IRF7-deficient patients from six families and five ancestries. Five were homozygous and two were compound heterozygous for IRF7 variants. Patients typically had one episode of pulmonary viral disease. Age at onset was surprisingly broad, from 6 mo to 50 yr (mean age 29 yr). The respiratory viruses implicated included SARS-CoV-2, influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and adenovirus. Serological analyses indicated previous infections with many common viruses. Cellular analyses revealed strong antiviral immunity and expanded populations of influenza- and SARS-CoV-2-specific memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. IRF7-deficient individuals are prone to viral infections of the respiratory tract but are otherwise healthy, potentially due to residual IFN-β and compensatory adaptive immunity.",{},{},{}
81,35668193,P2RY2-AKT activation is a therapeutically actionable consequence of XPO1 inhibition in acute myeloid leukemia - PubMed,"Abstract
        
      


      
      Selinexor is a first-in-class inhibitor of the nuclear exportin XPO1 that was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of multiple myeloma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. In relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML), selinexor has shown promising activity, suggesting that selinexor-based combination therapies may have clinical potential. Here, motivated by the hypothesis that selinexor's nuclear sequestration of diverse substrates imposes pleiotropic fitness effects on AML cells, we systematically catalog the pro- and anti-fitness consequences of selinexor treatment. We discover that selinexor activates PI3Kγ-dependent AKT signaling in AML by upregulating the purinergic receptor P2RY2. Inhibiting this axis potentiates the anti-leukemic effects of selinexor in AML cell lines, patient-derived primary cultures and multiple mouse models of AML. In a syngeneic, MLL-AF9-driven mouse model of AML, treatment with selinexor and ipatasertib outperforms both standard-of-care chemotherapy and chemotherapy with selinexor. Together, these findings establish drug-induced P2RY2-AKT signaling as an actionable consequence of XPO1 inhibition in AML.",{},{},{}
82,35666958,Circulating Tumor Cells for the Staging of Patients With Newly Diagnosed Transplant-Eligible Multiple Myeloma - PubMed,"Abstract
        
      



          Purpose:
        
      
      Patients with multiple myeloma (MM) may show patchy bone marrow (BM) infiltration and extramedullary disease. Notwithstanding, quantification of plasma cells (PCs) continues to be performed in BM since the clinical translation of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) remains undefined.
    


          Patients and methods:
        
      
      CTCs were measured in peripheral blood (PB) of 374 patients with newly diagnosed MM enrolled in the GEM2012MENOS65 and GEM2014MAIN trials. Treatment included bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone induction followed by autologous transplant, consolidation, and maintenance. Next-generation flow cytometry was used to evaluate CTCs in PB at diagnosis and measurable residual disease (MRD) in BM throughout treatment.
    


          Results:
        
      
      CTCs were detected in 92% (344 of 374) of patients with newly diagnosed MM. The correlation between the percentages of CTCs and BM PCs was modest. Increasing logarithmic percentages of CTCs were associated with inferior progression-free survival (PFS). A cutoff of 0.01% CTCs showed an independent prognostic value (hazard ratio: 2.02; 95% CI, 1.3 to 3.1; P = .001) in multivariable PFS analysis including the International Staging System, lactate dehydrogenase levels, and cytogenetics. The combination of the four prognostic factors significantly improved risk stratification. Outcomes according to the percentage of CTCs and depth of response to treatment showed that patients with undetectable CTCs had exceptional PFS regardless of complete remission and MRD status. In all other cases with detectable CTCs, only achieving MRD negativity (and not complete remission) demonstrated a statistically significant increase in PFS.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Evaluation of CTCs in PB outperformed quantification of BM PCs. The detection of ≥ 0.01% CTCs could be a new risk factor in novel staging systems for patients with transplant-eligible MM.",{},{},{}
83,35671424,Primary cilia in satellite cells are the mechanical sensors for muscle hypertrophy - PubMed,"Abstract
        
      


      
      Skeletal muscle atrophy is commonly associated with aging, immobilization, muscle unloading, and congenital myopathies. Generation of mature muscle cells from skeletal muscle satellite cells (SCs) is pivotal in repairing muscle tissue. Exercise therapy promotes muscle hypertrophy and strength. Primary cilium is implicated as the mechanical sensor in some mammalian cells, but its role in skeletal muscle cells remains vague. To determine mechanical sensors for exercise-induced muscle hypertrophy, we established three SC-specific cilium dysfunctional mouse models-Myogenic factor 5 (Myf5)-Arf-like Protein 3 (Arl3)-/-, Paired box protein Pax-7 (Pax7)-Intraflagellar transport protein 88 homolog (Ift88)-/-, and Pax7-Arl3-/--by specifically deleting a ciliary protein ARL3 in MYF5-expressing SCs, or IFT88 in PAX7-expressing SCs, or ARL3 in PAX7-expressing SCs, respectively. We show that the Myf5-Arl3-/- mice develop grossly the same as WT mice. Intriguingly, mechanical stimulation-induced muscle hypertrophy or myoblast differentiation is abrogated in Myf5-Arl3-/- and Pax7-Arl3-/- mice or primary isolated Myf5-Arl3-/- and Pax7-Ift88-/- myoblasts, likely due to defective cilia-mediated Hedgehog (Hh) signaling. Collectively, we demonstrate SC cilia serve as mechanical sensors and promote exercise-induced muscle hypertrophy via Hh signaling pathway.

84,35658487,"A Randomized, Phase III Trial to Evaluate Rucaparib Monotherapy as Maintenance Treatment in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Ovarian Cancer (ATHENA-MONO/GOG-3020/ENGOT-ov45) - PubMed","Abstract
        
      



          Purpose:
        
      
      ATHENA (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03522246) was designed to evaluate rucaparib first-line maintenance treatment in a broad patient population, including those without BRCA1 or BRCA2 (BRCA) mutations or other evidence of homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), or high-risk clinical characteristics such as residual disease. We report the results from the ATHENA-MONO comparison of rucaparib versus placebo.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Patients with stage III-IV high-grade ovarian cancer undergoing surgical cytoreduction (R0/complete resection permitted) and responding to first-line platinum-doublet chemotherapy were randomly assigned 4:1 to oral rucaparib 600 mg twice a day or placebo. Stratification factors were HRD test status, residual disease after chemotherapy, and timing of surgery. The primary end point of investigator-assessed progression-free survival was assessed in a step-down procedure, first in the HRD population (BRCA-mutant or BRCA wild-type/loss of heterozygosity high tumor), and then in the intent-to-treat population.
    


          Results:
        
      
      As of March 23, 2022 (data cutoff), 427 and 111 patients were randomly assigned to rucaparib or placebo, respectively (HRD population: 185 v 49). Median progression-free survival (95% CI) was 28.7 months (23.0 to not reached) with rucaparib versus 11.3 months (9.1 to 22.1) with placebo in the HRD population (log-rank P = .0004; hazard ratio [HR], 0.47; 95% CI, 0.31 to 0.72); 20.2 months (15.2 to 24.7) versus 9.2 months (8.3 to 12.2) in the intent-to-treat population (log-rank P < .0001; HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.40 to 0.68); and 12.1 months (11.1 to 17.7) versus 9.1 months (4.0 to 12.2) in the HRD-negative population (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.95). The most common grade ≥ 3 treatment-emergent adverse events were anemia (rucaparib, 28.7% v placebo, 0%) and neutropenia (14.6% v 0.9%).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Rucaparib monotherapy is effective as first-line maintenance, conferring significant benefit versus placebo in patients with advanced ovarian cancer with and without HRD.",{},{},{}
85,35660376,Risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission in households with asthmatic and allergic children. A prospective surveillance study - PubMed,"Abstract
        
      



          Background:
        
      
      Whether children and people with asthma and allergic diseases are at increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection is unknown.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To determine SARS-CoV-2 infection incidence in households with children, and whether self-reported asthma and/or other allergic diseases are associated with infection and household transmission.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Biweekly nasal swabs and weekly surveys were conducted for six months within 1,394 households (N=4,142 participants) to identify incident SARS-CoV-2 infections from May 2020-February 2021, a pandemic time period largely pre-vaccine and pre-emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants. Participant/household infection and household transmission probabilities were calculated using time-to-event analyses, and factors associated with infection and transmission risk determined using regression analyses.
    


          Results:
        
      
      147 households (261 participants) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Household SARS-CoV-2 infection probability was 25.8%; participant infection probability was similar for children (14.0%,CI:8.0-19.6%), teenagers (12.1%,CI:8.2-15.9%), and adults (14.0%,CI:9.5-18.4%). Infections were symptomatic in 24.5% of children, 41.2% of teenagers, and 62.5% of adults. Self-reported doctor-diagnosed asthma was not a risk factor for infection (aHR=1.04,CI:0.73-1.46), nor was upper respiratory allergy or eczema. Self-reported doctor-diagnosed food allergy was associated with lower infection risk (aHR=0.50,CI:0.32-0.81); higher BMI was associated with increased infection risk (aHR per 10-point increase:1.09,CI:1.03-1.15). Household secondary attack rate was 57.7%. Asthma was not associated with household transmission, but transmission was lower in households with food allergy (aOR=0.43,CI:0.19-0.96,p=0.04).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Asthma does not increase risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Food allergy is associated with lower infection risk, while BMI is associated with increased infection risk. Understanding how these factors modify infection risk may offer new avenues for infection prevention.

      Aminoacyl transfer RNA (tRNA) synthetases (aaRSs) are attractive drug targets, and we present class I and II aaRSs as previously unrecognized targets for adenosine 5'-monophosphate-mimicking nucleoside sulfamates. The target enzyme catalyzes the formation of an inhibitory amino acid-sulfamate conjugate through a reaction-hijacking mechanism. We identified adenosine 5'-sulfamate as a broad-specificity compound that hijacks a range of aaRSs and ML901 as a specific reagent a specific reagent that hijacks a single aaRS in the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, namely tyrosine RS (PfYRS). ML901 exerts whole-life-cycle-killing activity with low nanomolar potency and single-dose efficacy in a mouse model of malaria.

87,35658022,Once-Weekly Dulaglutide for the Treatment of Youths with Type 2 Diabetes - PubMed,"Abstract
        
      



          Background:
        
      
      The incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus is increasing among youths. Once-weekly treatment with dulaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, may have efficacy with regard to glycemic control in youths with type 2 diabetes.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 26-week trial, we randomly assigned participants (10 to <18 years of age; body-mass index [BMI], >85th percentile) being treated with lifestyle modifications alone or with metformin, with or without basal insulin, in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive once-weekly subcutaneous injections of placebo, dulaglutide at a dose of 0.75 mg, or dulaglutide at a dose of 1.5 mg. Participants were then included in a 26-week open-label extension study in which those who had received placebo began receiving dulaglutide at a weekly dose of 0.75 mg. The primary end point was the change from baseline in the glycated hemoglobin level at 26 weeks. Secondary end points included a glycated hemoglobin level of less than 7.0% and changes from baseline in the fasting glucose concentration and BMI. Safety was also assessed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 154 participants underwent randomization. At 26 weeks, the mean glycated hemoglobin level had increased in the placebo group (0.6 percentage points) and had decreased in the dulaglutide groups (-0.6 percentage points in the 0.75-mg group and -0.9 percentage points in the 1.5-mg group, P<0.001 for both comparisons vs. placebo). At 26 weeks, a higher percentage of participants in the pooled dulaglutide groups than in the placebo group had a glycated hemoglobin level of less than 7.0% (51% vs. 14%, P<0.001). The fasting glucose concentration increased in the placebo group (17.1 mg per deciliter) and decreased in the pooled dulaglutide groups (-18.9 mg per deciliter, P<0.001), and there were no between-group differences in the change in BMI. The incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events was higher with dulaglutide therapy than with placebo. The safety profile of dulaglutide was consistent with that reported in adults.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Treatment with dulaglutide at a once-weekly dose of 0.75 mg or 1.5 mg was superior to placebo in improving glycemic control through 26 weeks among youths with type 2 diabetes who were being treated with or without metformin or basal insulin, without an effect on BMI.

88,35660139,"Outcomes of the SARS-CoV-2 omicron (B.1.1.529) variant outbreak among vaccinated and unvaccinated patients with cancer in Europe: results from the retrospective, multicentre, OnCovid registry study - PubMed","Abstract
        
      



          Background:
        
      
      The omicron (B.1.1.529) variant of SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible and escapes vaccine-induced immunity. We aimed to describe outcomes due to COVID-19 during the omicron outbreak compared with the prevaccination period and alpha (B.1.1.7) and delta (B.1.617.2) waves in patients with cancer in Europe.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this retrospective analysis of the multicentre OnCovid Registry study, we recruited patients aged 18 years or older with laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, who had a history of solid or haematological malignancy that was either active or in remission. Patient were recruited from 37 oncology centres from UK, Italy, Spain, France, Belgium, and Germany. Participants were followed up from COVID-19 diagnosis until death or loss to follow-up, while being treated as per standard of care. For this analysis, we excluded data from centres that did not actively enter new data after March 1, 2021 (in France, Germany, and Belgium). We compared measures of COVID-19 morbidity, which were complications from COVID-19, hospitalisation due to COVID-19, and requirement of supplemental oxygen and COVID-19-specific therapies, and COVID-19 mortality across three time periods designated as the prevaccination (Feb 27 to Nov 30, 2020), alpha-delta (Dec 1, 2020, to Dec 14, 2021), and omicron (Dec 15, 2021, to Jan 31, 2022) phases. We assessed all-cause case-fatality rates at 14 days and 28 days after diagnosis of COVID-19 overall and in unvaccinated and fully vaccinated patients and in those who received a booster dose, after adjusting for country of origin, sex, age, comorbidities, tumour type, stage, and status, and receipt of systemic anti-cancer therapy. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04393974, and is ongoing.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      As of Feb 4, 2022 (database lock), the registry included 3820 patients who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 between Feb 27, 2020, and Jan 31, 2022. 3473 patients were eligible for inclusion (1640 [47·4%] were women and 1822 [52·6%] were men, with a median age of 68 years [IQR 57-77]). 2033 (58·5%) of 3473 were diagnosed during the prevaccination phase, 1075 (31·0%) during the alpha-delta phase, and 365 (10·5%) during the omicron phase. Among patients diagnosed during the omicron phase, 113 (33·3%) of 339 were fully vaccinated and 165 (48·7%) were boosted, whereas among those diagnosed during the alpha-delta phase, 152 (16·6%) of 915 were fully vaccinated and 21 (2·3%) were boosted. Compared with patients diagnosed during the prevaccination period, those who were diagnosed during the omicron phase had lower case-fatality rates at 14 days (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0·32 [95% CI 0·19-0·61) and 28 days (0·34 [0·16-0·79]), complications due to COVID-19 (0·26 [0·17-0·46]), and hospitalisation due to COVID-19 (0·17 [0·09-0·32]), and had less requirements for COVID-19-specific therapy (0·22 [0·15-0·34]) and oxygen therapy (0·24 [0·14-0·43]) than did those diagnosed during the alpha-delta phase. Unvaccinated patients diagnosed during the omicron phase had similar crude case-fatality rates at 14 days (ten [25%] of 40 patients vs 114 [17%] of 656) and at 28 days (11 [27%] of 40 vs 184 [28%] of 656) and similar rates of hospitalisation due to COVID-19 (18 [43%] of 42 vs 266 [41%] of 652) and complications from COVID-19 (13 [31%] of 42 vs 237 [36%] of 659) as those diagnosed during the alpha-delta phase.
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      Despite time-dependent improvements in outcomes reported in the omicron phase compared with the earlier phases of the pandemic, patients with cancer remain highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 if they are not vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. Our findings support universal vaccination of patients with cancer as a protective measure against morbidity and mortality from COVID-19.

89,35668135,The metabolic enzyme hexokinase 2 localizes to the nucleus in AML and normal haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells to maintain stemness - PubMed,"Abstract
        
      


      
      Mitochondrial metabolites regulate leukaemic and normal stem cells by affecting epigenetic marks. How mitochondrial enzymes localize to the nucleus to control stem cell function is less understood. We discovered that the mitochondrial metabolic enzyme hexokinase 2 (HK2) localizes to the nucleus in leukaemic and normal haematopoietic stem cells. Overexpression of nuclear HK2 increases leukaemic stem cell properties and decreases differentiation, whereas selective nuclear HK2 knockdown promotes differentiation and decreases stem cell function. Nuclear HK2 localization is phosphorylation-dependent, requires active import and export, and regulates differentiation independently of its enzymatic activity. HK2 interacts with nuclear proteins regulating chromatin openness, increasing chromatin accessibilities at leukaemic stem cell-positive signature and DNA-repair sites. Nuclear HK2 overexpression decreases double-strand breaks and confers chemoresistance, which may contribute to the mechanism by which leukaemic stem cells resist DNA-damaging agents. Thus, we describe a non-canonical mechanism by which mitochondrial enzymes influence stem cell function independently of their metabolic function.",{},{},{}

          Background:
        
      
      Consensus has not been reached on what constitutes an optimal diet in individuals with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes (T2DM), especially between low-carbohydrate options.
    


          Objectives:
        
      
      To compare two low-carbohydrate diets with 3 key similarities (incorporate non-starchy vegetables and avoid added sugars and refined grains) and 3 key differences (incorporate vs avoid legumes, fruits, and whole intact grains), for their effects on glucose control and cardiometabolic risk factors in individuals with prediabetes and T2DM.
    


          Design:
        
      
      Keto-Med was a randomized, crossover, interventional trial. Forty participants aged ≥ 18 years with prediabetes or T2DM followed a Well Formulated Ketogenic Diet (WFKD) and Mediterranean-Plus diet (Med-Plus) for 12-weeks each, in random order. Diets shared 3 key similarities noted above. Med-Plus incorporated legumes, fruits, and whole intact grains while WFKD avoided them. Primary outcome was % change in HbA1c after 12-weeks on each diet. Secondary and exploratory outcomes included % change in body weight, fasting insulin, glucose, and blood lipids, glucose (continuous glucose monitor), and nutrient intake.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Primary analysis had n = 33 with complete data. HbA1c did not differ between diets at 12-weeks. Triglycerides decreased more for WFKD (% change(SEM)): -16%(4%) vs -5%(6%), p = 0.02) and LDL-C was higher for WFKD (+10%(4%) vs -5%(5%), p = 0.01). Weight decreased 8%(1%) vs 7%(1%) and HDL-C increased 11%(2%) vs 7%(3%) for WFKD vs Med-Plus, respectively; however, there was a significant interaction of diet by order for both. Participants had lower intakes of fiber and 3 nutrients on WFKD vs Med-Plus. Twelve-week follow-up data suggested Med-Plus diet was more sustainable.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      HbA1c was not different between diet phases after 12-weeks, but improved from baseline on both diets, likely due to several shared dietary aspects. WFKD was beneficial for greater decrease in triglycerides, but also had potential untoward risks from elevated LDL-C, and lower nutrient intakes from avoiding legumes, fruits, and whole intact grains, as well as being less sustainable.

      Current organ preservation methods provide a narrow window (usually <12 hours) to assess, transport and implant donor grafts for human transplantation. Here we report the transplantation of a human liver discarded by all centers, which could be preserved for several days using ex situ normothermic machine perfusion. The transplanted liver exhibited normal function, with minimal reperfusion injury and the need for only a minimal immunosuppressive regimen. The patient rapidly recovered a normal quality of life without any signs of liver damage, such as rejection or injury to the bile ducts, according to a 1-year follow up. This inaugural clinical success opens new horizons in clinical research and promises an extended time window of up to 10 days for assessment of viability of donor organs as well as converting an urgent and highly demanding surgery into an elective procedure.",{},{},{}
92,34937674,Long Term Effectiveness and Safety of Intracavernosal Botulinum Toxin A as an Add-on Therapy to Phosphosdiesterase Type 5 Inhibitors or Prostaglandin E1 Injections for Erectile Dysfunction - PubMed,"Abstract
        
      



          Background:
        
      
      Some evidence suggests that intracavernosal botulinum toxin A (BTX-A IC) injections administered in addition to phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5-Is) or prostaglandin E1 intracavernosal injections (PGE1 ICI) could effectively treat erectile dysfunction (ED) in non-responders, or insufficient responders to these pharmacologic treatments.
    


          Aim:
        
      
      To determine the long-term effectiveness and safety of combined treatment involving a single injection of BTX-A IC as an add on therapy to PDE5-Is or PGE1-ICI for the treatment of ED of different etiologies.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      A retrospective, uncontrolled, single center study was conducted. Data from 123 consecutive patients with ED who were insufficient responders to PDE5-Is or PGE1-ICI and who received onabotulinumtoxinA 100 U, abobotulinumtoxinA 250 U or 500 U IC as an add on to their current pharmacologic treatment were analyzed. All analyses were exploratory. Qualitative data were compared using the Fisher's exact test. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed using logistic regression with Odds Ratios (OR). Only variables with P < .05 in the univariate analysis were selected for multivariate analysis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The minimally clinically important difference (relative to baseline severity of ED) in the International Index of Erectile Function-Erectile function domain (IIEF-EF) score was achieved in 50% of patients at 34 (27-42) days and in 41% at 5.9 (3.9 - 8.1) months following BTX-A IC in combination with PDE5-Is or PGE1 ICI. The severity of ED influenced response to BTX-A IC according to the multivariate analysis (OR = 0.3, IC(95%]) = (0.16 - 0.56). Neither being post prostatectomy nor the type of BTX-A affected the response. Effectiveness tended to decrease more over time with abobotulinumtoxinA 250 U than 500 U. The only side-effects were mild penile pain on injection (n = 1) and mild penile pain for 3 days following injection (n = 1); no systemic effects were reported.
    


          Clinical implications:
        
      
      BTX-A IC (all types) administered as an add on to registered pharmacologic treatments improved erectile function for at least 6 months in 41% of patients with ED of varying etiologies, and was safe.
    


          Strengths & limitations:
        
      
      A relatively large cohort of patients with ED was included, with a long follow-up period, however the study was retrospective, and uncontrolled.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This study provides preliminary evidence that BTX-A IC administered as an add-on therapy for ED that is insufficiently responsive to standard therapy is effective for at least 6 months, and is safe. Randomized clinical trials are now needed to fully confirm these results.

93,35653592,The International Consensus Classification of Mature Lymphoid Neoplasms: A Report from the Clinical Advisory Committee - PubMed,"Abstract
        
      


      
      Since the publication of the Revised European-American Classification of mature lymphoid neoplasms in 1994, subsequent updates of the classification of mature lymphoid neoplasms have been generated through iterative international efforts to achieve broad consensus among hematopathologists, geneticists, molecular scientists, and clinicians. Significant progress in the characterization of malignancies of the immune system in the last years, with many new insights provided by genomic studies, have led to the current proposal. We have followed the same process that was successfully used for the 3rd and 4th editions of the WHO classification of hematological neoplasms. The definition, recommended studies, and criteria for the diagnosis of many entities have been extensively refined. Some categories considered provisional are now upgraded to definite entities. Terminology of some diseases has been revised to adapt nomenclature to the current knowledge of their biology, but these modifications have been restricted to well-justified situations. Major findings from recent genomic studies have impacted the conceptual framework and diagnostic criteria for many disease entities. These changes will have an impact on optimal clinical management. The conclusions of this work are summarized in this report as the proposed International Consensus Classification (ICC) of mature lymphoid, histiocytic, and dendritic cell tumors.",{},{},{}
94,35623380,Clinical features and management of human monkeypox: a retrospective observational study in the UK - PubMed,"Abstract
        
      



          Background:
        
      
      Cases of human monkeypox are rarely seen outside of west and central Africa. There are few data regarding viral kinetics or the duration of viral shedding and no licensed treatments. Two oral drugs, brincidofovir and tecovirimat, have been approved for treatment of smallpox and have demonstrated efficacy against monkeypox in animals. Our aim was to describe the longitudinal clinical course of monkeypox in a high-income setting, coupled with viral dynamics, and any adverse events related to novel antiviral therapies.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      In this retrospective observational study, we report the clinical features, longitudinal virological findings, and response to off-label antivirals in seven patients with monkeypox who were diagnosed in the UK between 2018 and 2021, identified through retrospective case-note review. This study included all patients who were managed in dedicated high consequence infectious diseases (HCID) centres in Liverpool, London, and Newcastle, coordinated via a national HCID network.
    


          Findings:
        
      
      We reviewed all cases since the inception of the HCID (airborne) network between Aug 15, 2018, and Sept 10, 2021, identifying seven patients. Of the seven patients, four were men and three were women. Three acquired monkeypox in the UK: one patient was a health-care worker who acquired the virus nosocomially, and one patient who acquired the virus abroad transmitted it to an adult and child within their household cluster. Notable disease features included viraemia, prolonged monkeypox virus DNA detection in upper respiratory tract swabs, reactive low mood, and one patient had a monkeypox virus PCR-positive deep tissue abscess. Five patients spent more than 3 weeks (range 22-39 days) in isolation due to prolonged PCR positivity. Three patients were treated with brincidofovir (200 mg once a week orally), all of whom developed elevated liver enzymes resulting in cessation of therapy. One patient was treated with tecovirimat (200mg twice daily for 2 weeks orally), experienced no adverse effects, and had a shorter duration of viral shedding and illness (10 days hospitalisation) compared with the other six patients. One patient experienced a mild relapse 6 weeks after hospital discharge.
    


          Interpretation:
        
      
      Human monkeypox poses unique challenges, even to well resourced health-care systems with HCID networks. Prolonged upper respiratory tract viral DNA shedding after skin lesion resolution challenged current infection prevention and control guidance. There is an urgent need for prospective studies of antivirals for this disease.

95,35650445,Herpesvirus infections and post-COVID-19 manifestations: a pilot observational study - PubMed,"Abstract
        
      


      
      The global spread of SARS-CoV-2 points to unrivaled mutational variation of the virus, contributing to a variety of post-COVID sequelae in immunocompromised subjects and high mortality. Numerous studies have reported the reactivation of ""sluggish"" herpes virus infections in COVID-19, which exaggerate the course of the disease and complicate with lasting post-COVID manifestations CMV, EBV, HHV6). This study aimed to describe clinical and laboratory features of post-COVID manifestations accompanied by the reactivation of herpes virus infections (CMV, EBV, HHV6). 88 patients were recruited for this study, including subjects with reactivation of herpes viruses, 68 (72.3%) (main group) and 20 (27.7%) subjects without detectable DNA of herpesviruses (control group): 46 (52.3%) female and 42 (47.7%) male; median age was 41.4 ± 6.7 years. Patients with post-COVID manifestations presented with reactivation of EBV in 42.6%, HHV6 in 25.0%, and EBV plus HHV6 in 32.4%. Compared with controls, patients with herpes virus infections presented with more frequent slight fever temperature, headache, psycho-neurological disorders, pulmonary abnormalities and myalgia (p < 0.01), activation of liver enzymes, elevated CRP and D-dimer, and suppressed cellular immune response (p ≤ 0.05). Preliminary results indicate a likely involvement of reactivated herpes virus infections, primarily EBV infections in severe COVID-19 and the formation of the post-COVID syndrome. Patients with the post-COVID syndrome and reactivation of EBV and HHV6 infections are at high risk of developing various pathologies, including rheumatologic diseases.

96,35652390,Myocarditis after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination: A systematic review of case reports and case series - PubMed,"Abstract
        
      



          Background:
        
      
      The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic with over 266 million cases and 5 million deaths worldwide. Anti-COVID-19 vaccinations have had exceptional success in subduing the incidence, prevalence, and disease severity of COVID-19, but rare cases of myocarditis have been reported after COVID-19 vaccinations.
    


          Hypothesis:
        
      
      Myocarditis occurring after COVID-19 mRNA vaccinations have distinguishable clinical characteristics. They usually have a favorable prognosis.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We performed a systematic literature search on PUBMED and MEDLINE database from inception to December 5, 2021. Studies were analyzed based on predetermined eligibility criteria.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 57 studies containing 275 cases of COVID-19 vaccine-associated myocarditis were catalogued. Mean age was 26.7 years and male to female ratio was 14:1. For 86.9% of patients, myocarditis occurred after the second dose. Average time to onset and length of hospitalization were 3.7 and 3.9 days, respectively. Prognosis was largely benign, but there was a 1.1% reported mortality. Chest pain (95.2%), elevation of troponin (100%), and ST elevation on electrocardiography (68.5%) were common. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (81.4%) were the most used medication, followed by colchicine (33.1%).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Patients with COVID-19 vaccine-associated myocarditis are usually younger males presenting with chest pain 3-4 days after receiving their second dose of COVID vaccine. Diagnosis is made by exclusion of all other etiologies. Given significant population benefit from COVID-19 vaccination, physicians should continue to encourage vaccination while remaining vigilant of the very rare occurrence of myocarditis following COVID-19 vaccination.

97,35653469,A hold-and-feed mechanism drives directional DNA loop extrusion by condensin - PubMed,"Abstract
        
      


      
      Structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) protein complexes structure genomes by extruding DNA loops, but the molecular mechanism that underlies their activity has remained unknown. We show that the active condensin complex entraps the bases of a DNA loop transiently in two separate chambers. Single-molecule imaging and cryo-electron microscopy suggest a putative power-stroke movement at the first chamber that feeds DNA into the SMC-kleisin ring upon adenosine triphosphate binding, whereas the second chamber holds on upstream of the same DNA double helix. Unlocking the strict separation of ""motor"" and ""anchor"" chambers turns condensin from a one-sided into a bidirectional DNA loop extruder. We conclude that the orientation of two topologically bound DNA segments during the SMC reaction cycle determines the directionality of DNA loop extrusion.",{},"{'Adenosine Triphosphatases* / chemistry': True, 'Cryoelectron Microscopy': True, 'DNA* / chemistry': True, 'DNA-Binding Proteins* / chemistry': True, 'Multiprotein Complexes* / chemistry': True, 'Nucleic Acid Conformation': True, 'Single Molecule Imaging': True}","{'DNA-Binding Proteins': True, 'Multiprotein Complexes': True, 'condensin complexes': True, 'DNA': True, 'Adenosine Triphosphatases': True}"
98,35649360,An integrated model for Gpr124 function in Wnt7a/b signaling among vertebrates - PubMed,"Abstract
        
      


      
      Within the central nervous system, Wnt7a/b are unambiguously discriminated from other Wnt ligands by an endothelial receptor complex made of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored Reck and the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) Gpr124. Reck is a Wnt7a/b-specific receptor, while Gpr124 facilitates the delivery of Reck-bound Wnt7a/b ligands to Frizzled, through partially characterized mechanisms. We report that, in zebrafish, the Gpr124-Frizzled interactions are dominated by intracellular scaffolds that exploit the striking molecular mimicry between Gpr124 and Frizzled intracellular domains (ICDs): an internal Dvl-binding motif and a C-terminal ETTV motif that recruits Dlg4 and Magi3. By contrast, mammalian Gpr124 receptors exhibit an ICD-independent interaction mechanism governed by species-specific attributes of their transmembrane and extracellular domains. This mechanism seemingly evolved to replace the Dvl-mediated mechanism. By contrasting zebrafish, mouse, and human Gpr124, this study provides insights into the evolution of Gpr124/Reck function across the vertebrate clade, a receptor complex uniquely implicated in Wnt ligand-specific cellular responses.

99,35653061,"Predictors of Cladribine Effectiveness and Safety in Multiple Sclerosis: A Real-World, Multicenter, 2-Year Follow-Up Study - PubMed","Abstract
        
      



          Introduction:
        
      
      Cladribine administration has been approved for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) in 2017; thus, data on cladribine in a real-world setting are still emerging.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      We report on cladribine effectiveness, safety profile, and treatment response predictors in 243 patients with MS followed at eight tertiary MS centers. Study outcomes were: (1) No Evidence of Disease Activity-3 (NEDA-3) status and its components (absence of clinical relapses, MRI activity, and sustained disability worsening); (2) development of grade III/IV lymphopenia. The relationship between baseline features and the selected outcomes was tested via multivariate logistic models.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Of the 243 subjects included in the study (66.5% female, age 34.2 ± 10 years, disease duration 6.6 ± 9.6 years), 64% showed NEDA-3 at median follow-up (22 months). Patients with higher number of previous treatments had lower probability to retain NEDA-3 [odds ratio (OR) 0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41-0.98, p = 0.04] and were more prone to experience clinical relapses (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1-2.6, p = 0.04). The presence of active lesions at baseline was associated with follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) activity (OR 1.92, 95% CI 1.04-3.55, p = 0.04). Patients with higher rate of relapses in the year prior to cladribine start were at higher risk of developing sustained disability worsening (OR 2.95% CI 1-4.2, p = 0.04). Lymphopenia grade III/IV over the follow-up was associated with baseline lymphocyte count (OR 0.998, 95% CI 0.997-0.999, p = 0.01).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      In this large cohort, we confirm previous data about cladribine effectiveness on disease activity and disability worsening and provide information on response predictors that might inform therapeutic choices.
